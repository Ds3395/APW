        <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
        <p>My interest in chat-bots originated when I first started creating <a href="SimonProject.xhtml">Simon</a>.
        I started researching and learning about Chat-bots with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-chatbots-with-python" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.
        This taught me that there were three major types of bots: Rule Based, Retrieval Based, and Generative.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule Based</strong> chat-bots act how they sound. They have a set of pre-defined rules (such as questions
        and answers) that it cannot deviate from. To expand, these bots cannot generate their own answers but are given a set
        of questions that it can ask along with answers that it understands. These bots can be seen in places like with
        a customer support agent. Siri is a good example of a retrieval based chat-bot.

        <p><strong>Retrieval based</strong> chat-bots are more complex than simple rule based chat-bots and delve into the world of <a href="SimonProject.xhtml">Natural Language Processing</a>.
        They are given a database of predefined responses and the program tries to figure out the best response when the user gives a statement.

        <p><strong>Generative</strong> chat-bots are the most complex type of conversational AI. As the name implies, generative chat-bots
        are more advanced that retrieval based bots in the sense that they can generate text instead of retrieving it from a database.
