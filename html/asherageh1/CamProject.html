<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I created the Culinary Aid and Manager (C.A.M.) to be an aid in the kitchen to help the user prepare meals
and use machine learning to recommend a balanced diet for the user. The program uses speech recognition to interpret
  requests from the user and Text-to-Speech to aid the user in meal preparation.</p>
<p>Recipes are stored in a csv file and labelled by: meal type, complexity etc.
Cam can take requests such as "Give me an easy breakfast to make".
Cam will pick up on key-words such as "Easy" and "Breakfast" to guide the user (through instructions stored in a list)
through the preparation of the meal.</p>
<p>Cam will store the users meals in a secondary csv file with the given date the food was consumed in order to steer away from
this option upon the next request and give more variance to the next time a meal is requested
This feature can also be used to ensure a balanced diet for the user.</p>
<p>For households with multiple members:
User can give reference to Cam as to whom they are feeding (ie: themselves, the whole family, etc.) and
Cam will suggest meals accordingly.</p>
