	<p>12/12/19: Thus far Robert and Jake have managed to create a weather station with the ability to get the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the enviroment. We have used a raspberry Pi 3 and a adafruit BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity chip. We had trouble connecting the BME280 to the right port because we were confusing 0x77 and 0x76. We firgured it out.
	</p> 2/21/19: We have setup the raspbery pi with the proper software, attached and configued the pressure, temperature and humidity sensor, and printed all the parts for the anemometer.
