<h1>Project Proposal: Horror Host Extension</h1>

<p> I would like to create a chrome extension this year for Advanced Coding. My concept is this: a chrome extension that allows smaller horror hosts to have a way to sync up their commentary with a movie without having to buy the rights. The idea for this was inspired by the early days of Rifftrax. Rifftrax is the successor to MST3K, run by the original cast. Their business model was you would only buy an audio track of the commentary. You would buy the audio and get your own copy of the movie, and then sync them up using guidance on the audio track. This way they could riff whatever movie they want without worrying about obtaining the rights. Now they have enough money to afford to license movies, but this early business model always stuck with me.
</p>

<p><span title="Rifftrax is good, but miss the skits from MST"><img src="https://d1up1rl1l0y9i0.cloudfront.net/logo/RiffPlanet-social.jpg" width = "400" height = "292"></span></p>

<p>Horror hosts have been on decline in recent years, for similar reasons. With cable dying, these hosts don't really have a home. Only the truly big ones have been successful. Using the Rifftrax model, I have at least a small scale solution. I will create a chrome extension that syncs up a youtube video (containing the hosts commentary), and a streamed copy of the movie, pausing and switching between them to play the commentary at the proper times.
</p>

<p>The extension would read data off and access both youtube and a streaming site (I would probably start off using a free site to make testing easier, such as Tubi). On the streaming site it would read the timecode, and would be able to play and pause. On youtube, it would read the timecode and play and pause, but also would read data in the description. The youtuber would put timecodes in their description formatted a certain way: starting with the timecode of their video, followed by the time code for the movie (with brackets around it or something). The extension would also be able to switch tabs. The viewer would go to the youtube page, and then copy and paste the link to the movie. The video would start, and after it reached the first timecode stop it would open the film tab and play the movie. After it hits another timecode in the video description the film would stop and switch back to the youtube video. Back and forth. 
</p>

<p><span title="Tubi is the best free streaming service. Look at all this weird horror garbage!"><img src="../images/tubiqueue.PNG" style="width: 40vw; min-width: 330px;"></span></p>

<p>Though this will be difficult, it definitely is possible. There are chrome extensions which pause and play videos to sync up two viewers, and there are chrome extensions which can switch tabs. Whether I will be able to do it is a maybe, obviously, but I think I can learn a lot about chrome extensions by doing this, which will be interesting.

<h1>Horror Host Extension: Not Going Great... (12/30/2020)</h1>

<p>I started work on the extension, but it's going... poorly. I think I'm a bit out of my element. I don't know Javascript,
HTML, or just web design stuff very well. The very basics of making an extension elude me! I found some tutorials, but I had trouble
finding any that go over the basics that well. And making the Javascript uses a lot of commands I just don't have any experience with.
It's been pretty frustrating. Right now I'm trying to make it so you can input a link into the extension, and when you click
Submit it takes you to that link in a new tab. The form to submit the link shows up in the HTML for the extension, but I have no
idea how to get that information to the javascript or even how to get the Javascript to trigger at all. This should be the easy part
but I have no idea how to do it. I kind of just feel like I'm flailing in the dark. I've also had a lot of work recently, so it's
been hard to keep up on such an open ended project. I kind of want something a bit more structured. I've started doing some Unity
tutorials on their website, and they've been really good and helpful so far. Very structured, which is good for me right now. 
It would be cool to make a game in Unity, and I do have some ideas...</p>

<h1> Learning Unity: Going Well so Far (1/6/2021)</h1>

<p>So, I switched to learning Unity and I'm really happy I did. I've been enjoying it so much I've decided to change my
bridge project to be based in it. I've been doing the Unity Learn tutorials on their site, and they've been very helpful.
I've been doing the fundementals track, and finished most of it. The only thing I couldn't do it upload my 2D project to finish it
because something was wrong with the publishing add on to Unity. I think I have a good grasp of the basics. I was a little confused,
but after doing the scripting tutorial I really got and the potential of unity! I've already started work on my eventual bridge project
with coding movement. I might have to scrap all my work cause I'm probably doing it in a weird and suboptimal way, but it's been fun!
And it works decently well. What I now need to learn is more about scripting (mostly the normal and optimal way to do things, and about
how best to use events), and how to import models and animations from Blender (a 3d modeling and animation software) and how to use them.
I want to learn how to trigger animations, because that seems pretty important. Either way, really liking what I've learned so far, 
and have found it all very interesting.</p>

<h1>Rom Hacking SMT: Devil Summoner</h1>



<p>	For my advanced coding project I have been attempting to translate the game Shin 
Megami Tensei Devil Summoner for the PSP using a completely translated script and a ROM (basically a rip) of the game. 
While some people had translated the game completely, they had no hacking experience to actually 
implement their translation into the game proper. This is what I have been trying to do since the start of the school year. </p>

<p> The basic idea of ROM hacking is taking a file of a game and editing the hex in order to change the game. Editing the hex is necessary since 
the hackers do not have the source code of the game, just the finished product. The easiest form of ROM hacking is text editing. By simply 
replacing the hex to change each letter, the text in a game can be changed. This is also the most useful kind of 
hacking, since it can be used to translate games that remain untranslated by their developers. 
A famous example is Mother 3. This famous sequel to earthbound for the GBA was never released outside of Japan, 
despite the popularity of the series. Fans took it upon themselves to translate this game, and through ROM hacking, 
have made a version as good as any official translated release. </p>

<p><span title="Mother 3"><img src="https://legendsoflocalization.com/media/mother-3/chapter1-2/mother2-tessie.png"></span></p>

<p>Through a bit of research, I figured out the first step of ROM hacking for a translation is to make a table file. 
The basic idea of this is that each letter in a ROM has a value. For example, in plain text, A = 1, then after A 
comes B, so B = 2. The only problem is, A usually isn’t 1. A might be 28. But, the order is the same. If A = 28, 
B must equal 29. To make a table for a ROM hack, the hacker would first find the file in which the text of the game 
is stored. Then use relative search to find a word they know is in the game. Take the word “cat”. C(3) A(1) T(20). 
In terms of numbers, the second number must be 2 less than the first, and the third 19 more than the second number. 
If you put “cat” into a relative search program, it would recognize 15 13 32 as “cat”. 13 is 2 less than 15, and 32 = 13 + 19. 
The longer sting you use, the more likely the match you would find it correct. After you find out the value of one letter, 
you know the values of the rest of the alphabet. For example, if C is 15 than D must be 16. If you make a table file listing 
all the letters and their equivalents, you can put that into a program and it can interpret the hex into readable text. </p>

<p>This is for english, but for Japanese it’s similar, since their phonetic characters also have a set order or “alphabet”. 
There are some outliers with the non-phonetic characters called “Kanji”, but those can be added to the table as well. 
My main problem is, I cannot find which file in the game contains the text. The game is relatively advanced compared to older games.
An NES game, for example, is one 1 file. My game, however is hundreds of files, and I cannot seem to find which file the text 
is stored in. After some digging, I found out that someone actually has. I am not the first person to attempt to hack this game.
They gave up, however, because of the translated script being poorly formatted (it only lists the english, and not the Japanese
counterpart). I have found their table file and a dump of the text of the game they made, but I still cannot file which file
they used to make this. I have also had some problems using a relative search tool called Monkey Moore, but I did manage to
get it to work with an English NES file, so I think the problem was either I was looking in the wrong files, or I was
formatting my Japenese test stings incorrectly. It’s hard to tell. Even with the table file, I cannot for the life of me
figure out where the text is stored. If I did, however, I would use some sort of hex editor or injector program to replace
the Japanese text with English text. I could use the ingame English font, but it’s quite large and only has uppercase letters.
Ideally I would hack into a new font, but I would have to research how to do that (though it has been done on the same 
type of ROM I’m hacking, specifically Steins Gate before is was officially translated). I know hacking english into this 
game is possible, the person who worked on it before me uploaded some screenshots contained hacked in English text 
(albeit with the built in English font). My biggest hurdle right now is just finding where the text actually is. If I can 
actually do that I can finally start actually making some real tangible progress. To be fair, I have learned a lot about ROM 
hacking and have made a lot of progress from the beginning where I knew practically nothing. My real goal now is to actually 
have something to show for all that I’ve learned.</p>


<h2>Update: 5/20/2020</h2>

<p>I've been working at this for awhile now, and made some more progress. Unsuprisingly, I've also hit a new
roadblock. I tried searching directly for the hex value of a letter instead of using a table search tool like
Monkey-Moore or Madedit. This worked, and I found a string of letters I knew were in the game. Perfect! Now
I just have to run and it see what it looks like in game, right? Nope. For some reason, the game won't run again
if it's decompressed. If I extract the files from the .iso and try to run them, the game never starts. Same thing
happens even if I repack them into an iso again. It isn't the edits I made either, if I unpack the game and then
repack it again without editing it, the same error occurs. I also tried using a program that can edit iso files
without decompressing them, but again I had the same issue. It seems if the file is tampered with at all, it won't
run. This could be some sort of copy protection, but I'm not sure. I'm also not sure how the person who hacked this
rom before me got it to work. I have a few ideas. First, someone has made a successful translation hack of another
game from the same company (Atlus) as this game. If I can see what they did in their hack, maybe I can fix it. I... 
Wait I think I just figured it out I'll be right back.</p>

<p>Okay fix I thought of I just misremembered but I'm gonna try a few things be right back.</p>

<h2>Update: 6/04/2020</h2>

I did it. It works. For Real. What I did, is instead of extracting the iso file, editing it, and then putting it back into an iso, I edited the unextracted
iso file. Since everything in the extracted file is techincally in the hex for the iso file, all the data was still in there, just not seperated. To test this, I simply
changed every instance of the letters "DDS" in the game to "AAS". Since the word "DDS" shows up very early in the game, and it in english letters, it was a quick and easy test.
This time, it worked, and the game ran.

<p><span title="As you can see, DDS is now AAS. Hey, is that Mr. Golanka?"><img src="../images/AAS.png" style="width: 40vw; min-width: 330px;"></span></p>

<p>After this, I translated a whole line of dialogue</p>

<p><span title="I mean I forgot a space and it's in all caps, but it's English!"><img src="../images/Translated.png" style="width: 40vw; min-width: 330px;"></span></p>

<p>I translated that line by going in a manually editing the text of each letter with a table to tell me what hex is what letter. This is very tedious and slow,
and translating the whole game like this would take me a very very long time. The next step, if I continue, would be a text extraction program like cartographer to extract the
text. I could then edit the text file without having to worry about the hex, and then use the same program to insert the hex back in, without having to manually edit
each letter myself. But, I finally got English text to display! Horray! It took a long time, but I sure learned a lot about hex editing and files and download SO many
useless programs. I had a great time on this project, and hopefully I'll find the time to continue it on my own :).</p>
