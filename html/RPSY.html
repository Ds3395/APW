	I am very interested in screenwriting and am now learning the industry standard software called Final Draft Pro. I'm really excited! Here is the link to the software.
	<p>
	Dec 11th Update. I have continued to learn the software.
	<p>
	Dec 20th Update. I finished working on learning the script softwaare and wrote a meta teach back incorporating the software. Now I am on winter break.
	<p>
	Jan 6th Update. Now that I have finished my teachback, I am continuing to refine my knowledge of the software and play around with it more. I am writing a script within it for fun.

	<p>
	Jan 15th Update. I have finished learning the screenwriting software and have moved on to my next project. I am currently taking the lead on my Enviornmental history classes website. I am working on the backend of squarespace with both html and the built in webstie customizer.

	I began this semester by learning the script writing software Final Draft. It is the industry standard software and is extremely helpful in not only learning the craft of screenwriting, but also accessing your creativity. It allows you to map out your story across virtual note cards, story boards, and take a step back and look scene by scene. I had a lot of fun learning this software and was actually able to use it to write some of my college supplements. In addition to learning this software, I have taken the lead on my Environmental History class’s website about rivers. It is a Wordpress site that I am working on both the back and front end of and am collaborating with Mr. Golanka as well. I have done some html work as well as learning the Wordpress interface and plugins. I have had a really great time during this first semester.
