<p> First Semester:

<p> For my project that I am going to try now I am going to create a madlibs story that asks the user to fill in missing words. Without knowing what the story is about the user will input nouns, verbs, names, places, etc, and those words will be inserted in the story in the correct place. To do this I will have to figure out how to get user input in a text box and how to insert words into the middle of other text. 

<p>12/20/20: I have a few lines that will be used as the story, as well as where the user can type there words. The users words are currently added to the end of the story. I now need to find a way to put the words that the user types into the currect place in the story.

<p>1/10/21: I currently have a short but working madlibs game, where the user inserts 3 words of a given part of speech and it correctly inputs them into the story. It then reveals the final story when the "madlibify" button is pressed. I am probobly going to make this story longer.

<p>1/17/21: Added one more place for the user to input a word.

<p>1/20/21: Added two more places for the user to input words.


<p> <font color="purple"> This semester: The first thing I did this semester was of course, making my main webpage, and adding it to the class site. Making this webpage helped my learn how to put text, images, and buttons onto a webpage. After making this webpage I started to learn how to use git to upload my work.

<p> This semester my main project has been working on a Madlibs game. This game asks the user to fill in missing words. Without knowing what the story is about, the user is asked to input verbs, names, places, etc, into a textbox. Once the "Madlibify" button is pressed, the story appears with the users words correctly placed into the story. In order to do this I had to figure out how to get user input in a text box aswell as how to insert that input into the middle of other pre-written text. This took a little while to figure out, but now that I have I can fairly easily add more places for the user to add words into the story.

<p> This semester I also presented a teachback. For my teachback I researched the history of different social media platforms, as well as how they have changed overtime. I chose this topic because we all use social media almost daily, and I wanted to see how different platforms had changed and improved over the years. 

<p> <font color="black"> Second Semester: 

<p> 2/25/21: I have been playing around with some tutorials that I found online, and I am now looking into either making some sort of helpful or some interesting game I think of.

<p> 3/2/21: I am going to try to make a program that allows you to create and use your own flashcards, so i'm looking into how to do parts of this.

<p> 3/17/21: I currently have a question with a textbox. If the user writes the correct or incorrect answer they will get a pop-up saying so. Yay! (I also have a next question button that doesn't fully work yet.)

<p> 4/8/21: I now have three working questions then you can go through with the next question button. I am now trying to make it so the user can make and add their own questions.

<p> 4/23/21: Brought text box to center and changed formatting.

<p> 5/5/21: NFT Teachback

<p> 5/12/21: My program does everything I want it to and is pretty much fully functional now. (Hooray!) It just looks kind of boring so I might add some fancy colors or something :-]

<p> <font color="purple"> In the first semester my main goal/project was to create a working Madlibs game. The game asks the user to fill in missing words in a story without knowing what the story is about. It took a little while to figure out how to get this to work, but it ended up being succesfull and I learned how to do a bunch of new things. The first semester I also researched and presented on the history of different social media platforms.

<p> This second semester my goal was to create a program the basically works as flashcards, where you can go through questions that you added, type in your answer, and it will tell you if you got it correct. I think this project was a little bit harder, specifically to get all the questions to display in the right place and at the right time, when buttons are clciked. This program ended up being successful and also works just as I had hoped, and a also leanrned more that I can do now. In the second semester I also researched and presented on Non-Fungible Tokens.
