    <h1>Joshua Screen's </h1>
    <p><strong>(a) What was your contribution to the class website project and what did you learn from it?</strong></p> 
    <p>I did a mad lib program where you have to fill in words and it fills them into a story. I used html, javascript, and css
        to make the program. I learned more about github and things about collaborative work.
    </p>

    <p><strong>(b) What project? </strong></p>
    <p>I want to work with either Arduino or RasberryPi. Anything involving hardware. 
        I have always been interested and I want to learn more about how it works and the uses 
        of it.
