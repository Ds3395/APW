<p>a) I made a webpage that displayed text and a button. When the button was clicked it displayed another message that said "HELP ME!" Even though learning how to navigate GitHub and Javascript was difficult, it definitely showed me the benefits of being able to collaborate online. Rather than having to copy and paste someone's code numerous times, each of us could work at our own pace and easily upload what everyone else had done to our own computer. Also, through my efforts in making a button that displays text and by looking through other students' code I think I have been able to obtain a basic grasp on how to code using Javascript. <p>

<p>b) The next project I will be working on is a joint animation with Phoebe. We both plan to learn how to use Adobe Animate throughout the year, which probably requires learning the coding language used by Adobe and the use of graphic tablets. Our skills will eventually culminate towards the end of the semester into a short or miniature animation scene that we will show the class.<p>
