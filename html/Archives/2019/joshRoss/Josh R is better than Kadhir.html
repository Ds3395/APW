<h1>Josh R is Better than Kadhir</h1>
<p>
	For this project I made a website say that Jason Daniels sucked. I also added a button to my website allowing people to agree with my statement. For my next project I might just continue fooling around with html to see what else I can make. I might try to learn a new lnguage like Maya, or IOS. I also might try to learn Markdown better because I am using it in history. Finally, I might try to make  game on processing. However, for now, I think I will continue to work on my website.
