<br>To Mary Jo Salter
<br>
<br>Beyond the ice-bound stones and bucking trees,
<br>past bewildered Mary, the Meer in snow,
<br>two skating rinks and two black crooked paths
<br>
<br>are a battered pair of reading glasses
<br>scratched by the skater’s multiplying math.
<br>Beset, I play this game of tic-tac-toe.
<br>
<br>Divide, subtract. Who can tell if love surpasses?
<br>Two naughts we’ve learned make one astonished 0—
<br>a hectic night of goats and compasses.
<br>
<br>Folly tells the truth by what it’s not—
<br>one X equals a fall I’d not forgo.
<br>Are ice and fire the integers we’ve got?
<br>
<br>Skating backwards tells another story—

<br>I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
<br>In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
<br>Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
<br>To bend and barter at desire’s call.
<br>Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet
<br>Go prowling through the night from street to street!
<br>
<br>Through the long night until the silver break
<br>Of day the little gray feet know no rest;
<br>Through the lone night until the last snow-flake
<br>Has dropped from heaven upon the earth’s white breast,
<br>The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet
<br>Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.
<br>
<br>Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way
<br>Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,
<br>Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,
<br>The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!
<br>Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet
<br>In Harlem wandering from street to street.

<br>Inhabiting apartments where the compass
<br>turns to the Upper West Side, single Jews
<br>who’re modern orthodox live on Columbus,
<br>Broadway, even Riverside, whose views
<br>of Hudson River are spectacular,
<br>while some to West End Avenue may cling,
<br>Yeshivish language their vernacular,

<br>For twenty-, thirtysomethings it’s a chance
<br>to meet so many partners who are not
<br>beshert that they forget about romance,
<br>and often look behind, like Mrs. Lot,
<br>to see if those they have abandoned may
<br>be better than the ones they’re chasing. Gaucher
<br>than those who have abandoned frumkeit, they
<br>insist that their relationships be kosher.

<br>Under Grand Central’s tattered vault
<br>—maybe half a dozen electric stars still lit—
<br>one saxophone blew, and a sheer black scrim
<br>
<br>billowed over some minor constellation
<br>under repair. Then, on Broadway, red wings
<br>in a storefront tableau, lustrous, the live macaws
<br>
<br>preening, beaks opening and closing
<br>like those animated knives that unfold all night
<br>in jewelers’ windows. For sale,
<br>
<br>glass eyes turned outward toward the rain,
<br>the birds lined up like the endless flowers
<br>and cheap gems, the makeshift tables
<br>
<br>of secondhand magazines
<br>and shoes the hawkers eye
<br>while they shelter in the doorways of banks.
<br>
<br>So many pockets and paper cups
<br>and hands reeled over the weight
<br>of that glittered pavement, and at 103rd
<br>
<br>a woman reached to me across the wet roof
<br>of a stranger’s car and said, I’m Carlotta,
<br>I’m hungry. She was only asking for change,
<br>
<br>so I don’t know why I took her hand.
<br>The rooftops were glowing above us,
<br>enormous, crystalline, a second city
<br>
<br>lit from within. That night
<br>a man on the downtown local stood up
<br>and said, My name is Ezekiel,
<br>
<br>I am a poet, and my poem this evening is called
<br>fall. He stood up straight
<br>to recite, a child reminded of his posture
<br>
<br>by the gravity of his text, his hands
<br>hidden in the pockets of his coat.
<br>Love is protected, he said,
<br>
<br>the way leaves are packed in snow,
<br>the rubies of fall. God is protecting
<br>the jewel of love for us.
<br>
<br>He didn’t ask for anything, but I gave him
<br>all the change left in my pocket,
<br>and the man beside me, impulsive, moved,
<br>
<br>gave Ezekiel his watch.
<br>It wasn’t an expensive watch,
<br>I don’t even know if it worked,
<br>
<br>but the poet started, then walked away
<br>as if so much good fortune
<br>must be hurried away from,
<br>
<br>before anyone realizes it’s a mistake.
<br>Carlotta, her stocking cap glazed
<br>like feathers in the rain,
<br>
<br>under the radiant towers, the floodlit ramparts,
<br>must have wondered at my impulse to touch her,
<br>which was like touching myself,
<br>
<br>the way your own hand feels when you hold it
<br>because you want to feel contained.
<br>She said, You get home safe now, you hear?
<br>
<br>In the same way Ezekiel turned back
<br>to the benevolent stranger.
<br>I will write a poem for you tomorrow,
<br>
<br>he said. The poem I will write will go like this:
<br>Our ancestors are replenishing
<br>the jewel of love for us.

<br>Endlessly subdued, a sound
<br>Pours up from the crowd,
<br>Like some one ever gasping for breath

<br>Through the artificial valley
<br>Made by gaudy evasions,
<br>The stifled crowd files up and down,
<br>Stabbing thought with rapid noises.
<br>Women strutting dulcetly,
<br>Embroider their unappeased hungers,

<br> I
<br>
<br>Between these frowning granite steeps
<br>The human river onward sweeps;
<br>And here it moves with torrent force,
<br>And there it slacks its heady course:
<br>But what controls its variant flow
<br>A keener wit than mine must show,
<br>Who cast myself upon the tide,
<br>And merging with its current glide--
<br>A drop, an atom, of the whole
<br>Of its great bulk and wandering soul.
<br>
<br>O curbless river, savage stream,
<br>Thou art my wilderness extreme,
<br>Where I may move as free, as lone,
<br>As in the waste with wood o'ergrown,
<br>And broodings of as brave a strain
<br>May here unchallenged entertain,
<br>Whether meridian light display
<br>The swift routine of current day,
<br>Or jet electric, diamond-clear,
<br>Convoke a world of glamour here.
<br>
<br>Yet when of solitude I tire,
<br>Speak comradeship to my desire,
<br>O most companionable tide,
<br>Where all to all are firm allied,
<br>And each hath countenance from the rest,
<br>Although the tie be unconfessed!
<br>
<br>II
<br>
<br>I muse upon this river's brink;
<br>I listen long; I strive to think
<br>What cry goes forth, of many blent,
<br>And by that cry what thing is meant--
<br>What simple legend of old fate
<br>Man's voice, here inarticulate,
<br>From out this dim and strange uproar
<br>Still heaves upon the skyey shore!
<br>
<br>Amid this swift, phantasmal stream
<br>Sometimes I move as in a dream;
<br>Then wondrous quiet, for a space,
<br>The clanging tumult will displace;
<br>And toil's hard gride and pleasure's hum
<br>No longer to my ear may come:
<br>A pantomimic, haunted throng
<br>Fareth in silence deep and strong,
<br>And seems in summoned haste to urge,
<br>Half prescient, towards a destined verge!
<br>
<br>The river flows--unwasting flows;
<br>Nor less nor more its volume grows,
<br>From source to sea still onward rolled,
<br>As days are shed and years are told;
<br>And yet, so mutable its wave,
<br>That no man twice therein may lave,
<br>But, ere he can return again,
<br>Himself shall subtle change sustain;
<br>Since more and more each life must be
<br>Tide-troubled by the drawing sea.

<br> PART ONE
<br>
<br>I
<br>
<br>Slip-pilings on the Brooklyn littoral
<br>—the poles still tarry, flimsy; the ferry terminus
<br>with its walledup doors wan doorshapes
<br>on eroded sills. Downstream, the strutwork
<br>of the Williamsburg cable tower
<br>threw its cool shadow half a mile inland
<br>over tarpaper seams, gantried water butts,
<br>and splintery tenement cornices milled
<br>with acanthus and classical grasses
<br>of nineteenth-century dream-slum fantasy.
<br>We could see, from our rooftops, the endspan
<br>floating its ant-threads of traffic
<br>to the granite salients of the anchorage,
<br>and through its strands on the west
<br>the Financial District’s watery silhouettes.
<br>
<br>But it was our own foundations, crumbling
<br>in the sandy soil, that made us protest
<br>the drill rigs sounding for a wider bridge ramp
<br>to funnel the airport traffic over us
<br>into Manhattan. “Construction tremors
<br>will weaken our buildings”: from the over-roosted
<br>tenements clinging near the anchorage
<br>flew manuscript lists of signatures, block-groups’
<br>painfully Englished petitions. But City Hall
<br>adoze, sleep-feeding, just flooded us
<br>
<br>
<br>II
<br>
<br>with chimerical figures and blueprints,
<br>wearing us down. Our own “block-leader,” Luz,
<br>a Guatemalan law student at NYU
<br>where I studied classics, distracted us
<br>more easily with her “pure language”
<br>or anti-Puerto Rican tirades. “Call that Spanish?
<br>Take my sitter—muy indio, still speaks some
<br>Maya mountain-language BUT
<br>the beautiful Spanish!” And so one evening this sitter,
<br>Pilar, came over—forty, perhaps, with a long
<br>fawn-tinted oval face, and read in low tones
<br>an archaic poem to the Madonna. “My daughter
<br>knows it in Quiché and English—” and she passed around,
<br>wistfully, a First Communion photo—flat cheekbones
<br>like her mother’s, long black braids, straight look.
<br>
<br>Luz told us Pilar had lost husband
<br>and son to the Violence; a machine-gunned
<br>death heap in the center of their village—
<br>“They killed all the men. But when my family
<br>came here, she came with her girl, we helped with the
<br>green card, and she’s a hotel maid now
<br>near the UN ...” Much realer, this, than our own
<br>bridge-inflicted, some-day disaster. And who knew
<br>but our bridge might metamorphose,
<br>as the City said (“Global cities draw capital”), into a river
<br>of money (“We’ll all sell cuchifritos on the ramp”),
<br>and anyway, mainly, summer
<br>
<br>
<br>III
<br>
<br>was running out, with its open evenings
<br>and windows. One Saturday, turning onto my block
<br>from the subway, I heard my name, crossed
<br>the street where twin buildings had area-ways.
<br>and saw you waving, the same, Pilar,
<br>from a window below the swag-bellied area railings.
<br>“Come have some coffee—go around in back.”
<br>I walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered
<br>airwell by a door with multiple doorbells.
<br>You opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted,
<br>with padlocked doors. “See, the super’s cut up his flat
<br>for illegals. They took out an inside wall, so our room
<br>has a window—we all share the bath.” I entered
<br>a lime-walled room—chairs and table, sofa-bed. Your front wall
<br>was the building front, the three others
<br>drywall. On the bureau, a black-shawled
<br>prie-dieu: two photos; two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks,
<br>and a polychrome Madonna with meeting brows.
<br>
<br>Through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above,
<br>my own second-story windows. “We saw you
<br>reading there,” you said from behind me, “when we moved in.”
<br>You sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter
<br>(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) Near her, a shallow,
<br>linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. You said:
<br>“I’m a widow from the mountains near Morache, very near
<br>the home-town of Señora Luz. My real work is hotel maid, and I’ve got
<br>a nice job, at a place called the Tricontinental.”
<br>Then you paused, and I felt how clearly
<br>you’d presented yourself, as Americans do, with your job,
<br>your état civil, and I said: “I’m a graduate student
<br>at NYU, where Luz studies, no, not married, no children ...”
<br>I tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ...
<br>definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors,
<br>and soon we were hardly listening, waiting
<br>for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. Pequita
<br>told us what the priest had said
<br>about the drilling; you spoke of Pequita’s
<br>First Communion, and none of us could stop
<br>finding striking things to say. Next day you came over
<br>to see my plants, and I came back for soup-supper, looking up
<br>at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light
<br>of autumn looked oddly beckoning. As we ate,
<br>you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue’s smile,
<br>and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge,
<br>“There’s a path up there. If the bridge
<br>is bad, we’ll tell off the Mayor—” (In what spirit, I wondered,
<br>had you listened to our committee?) And when I got home
<br>I looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you
<br>cleaning up, and Pequita, at the table, reading.
<br>
<br>
<br>IV
<br>
<br>
<br>But next week, instead of the plank stair
<br>that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered
<br>the riverside shipping alleys. From below, we could see
<br>overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel
<br>the resonant top-thrum of westbound
<br>subways and trucks. Then the riverside—I loved
<br>this part. A sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny
<br>terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside
<br>from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers’ lots
<br>filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned
<br>panicles of switchgrass. Its timelessness
<br>soothed me—though ephemeral. Even that day, one freshly
<br>tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze
<br>Edwardian mermaid doorknockers. I could see
<br>our quarter five years from now, say—the withering
<br>discount chains, tentative boutiques,
<br>and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale
<br>“pioneers,” as neighborhood indigenes, living on
<br>with strange literalness among them, supplying
<br>their just-permissible quantum of urban grit.
<br>
<br>You were ahead, and Pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks
<br>with a stray lath. As we progressed in and out
<br>of the endspan’s slatted shadows, you turned
<br>and called me into a side-lot—sunken concrete, flask-
<br>green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. It had been
<br>interior, once—rows of soiled roomsized
<br>plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling
<br>toilet, like a pearl. In a lower square, fringed
<br>with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti,
<br>was a mural. Muy latino: the mountain
<br>dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees
<br>and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled
<br>castanets. And you lifted yourself on tiptoe,
<br>Pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed
<br>Pequita’s cheek. I felt a pang, as if I already needed you
<br>sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture
<br>as if, exiled within, you reached out— We stepped
<br>back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said:
<br>“Luz likes to say I’m some mountain-woman, but when
<br>my mother died, I lived with my aunt in the City—I only
<br>went back when I married.” I told her I’d lived
<br>in this city, with a stepmother, who’d divorced my uncle
<br>to marry my father; and beat me. “A stepmother’s
<br>a curse of God,” you said gently. And on the walk back,
<br>pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until New York
<br>seemed a dot in a belt of capitals
<br>high on the globe: world-cities, packed
<br>with immigrants, refugees, Gastarbeiter: a snowy
<br>latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.
<br>
<br>
<br>V
<br>
<br>
<br>We were a threesome. Coffee, suppers, TV,
<br>Pequita at my computer—you’d asked me to teach her—
<br>or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month
<br>they moved you to night shift. Yet only that summer,
<br>I’d worked in my window like a scholar
<br>in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises,
<br>like Roman Juvenal, to whose ears “came ever
<br>the sounds of buildings collapsing.” Across, the two
<br>tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails
<br>of fire-escape bedding. And everything underlit
<br>by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street.
<br>
<br>But now it was the dailiness of two
<br>from another hemisphere. Through snow-fissures, winds fluting
<br>on railings and building-flaws, Pilar in her low frame
<br>paced with armfuls of laundry, washed
<br>in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. The thousand
<br>stratagems of those who simply must not spend;
<br>and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred
<br>periphery, housekeeping around her,
<br>you’d make yourself interrupt her, to mop
<br>behind your sweeping. And Pequita—I saw her wrap
<br>you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you
<br>orange juice, as they’d taught her in school, for she
<br>loved you, she was the person who loved you—
<br>I saw too, that of what I wanted the university
<br>to be for me—a tiny model of the city
<br>with its own rules and subsets: “Tell me
<br>each day who I am”—you’d found your part
<br>in Pequita; I followed the shape
<br>of your day touching center as it funneled
<br>into her hand and moving pencil-point.
<br>
<br>
<br>VI
<br>
<br>
<br>For everything seemed natural to Pequita:
<br>the Credo, her photocopied choir music
<br>piled beside the tidy prie-dieu,
<br>our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps,
<br>her school’s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ...
<br>Our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal
<br>to her was a matter-of-fact Eden, like the picturesque ruins
<br>and laughably rococo grottoes imagined
<br>
<br>by the seicento as the Golden Age.
<br>—And I, I thought her whole world, it comes back—
<br>touching, as if her child’s paradisial will were there
<br>for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully,
<br>occasionally, typed-up and dispatched
<br>protests from the Ramp Committee to the Mayor. Slight effects
<br>of perspective, tiny human gestures
<br>giving point to the city’s vast, ironic beauty.
<br>
<br>
<br>PART TWO
<br>
<br>
<br>VII
<br>
<br>
<br>At a moment when no one was thinking
<br>about her, Pequita awoke. Perhaps
<br>she enjoyed the solitude, Pilar asleep,
<br>me asleep across the street. She got up
<br>and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug
<br>before the sink. At seven the drills started,
<br>deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)—
<br>and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam
<br>splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug—
<br>The person screaming over the phone
<br>was Pilar. I thought it must be really
<br>all right, or she’d be crying not screaming,
<br>but when I’d called 911 and run over, Pequita
<br>was barely alive.
<br>
<br>Then the hospital corridors,
<br>me trying to close my winter coat
<br>(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you
<br>on a bench, staring straight ahead.
<br>When they said Pequita was
<br>“gone,” you were utterly silent. I brought you
<br>to my place (though our street was a tangle
<br>of police lights and yellow tape), terrified
<br>of your fixed inner focus, as if you had
<br>a plan ... Next night I had Luz stay over,
<br>I slept at her place; the third I was back. You,
<br>thank God (I thought), were crying, and Luz
<br>had set up the service. She propelled us downstairs
<br>and to a tiny brick church I must often have passed
<br>without seeing it, two blocks inland.
<br>
<br>Egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green
<br>and gilt altar, dark Stations on the walls,
<br>and the statue of the Virgin of Guadeloupe
<br>placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that Pilar,
<br>after the death-mass, could kneel
<br>before her, praying straight into her face,
<br>while I on a kneeler buried mine in my hands.
<br>What would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or Luz,
<br>already writing more endless mad letters? Yet only these
<br>had from the City real answers: they’d brace the drill site
<br>with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted
<br>her and her friend Mrs. Citrin to know
<br>“that no one else had been more than lightly injured.”
<br>
<br>
<br>VIII
<br>
<br>
<br>It was the end of winter, very dark. The building
<br>managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor
<br>next door, till you found a new place (I knew
<br>you weren’t looking). Each day I saw you
<br>arrive from work, answer my call tersely,
<br>then pull down your blinds. A shadow showed rarely,
<br>flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot.
<br>“Thanks Anne—I’m better without company,” or
<br>“please understand.” But often, later
<br>in the evening, you’d come down the stairs
<br>and turn inland. Then, one morning as I was passing
<br>with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall
<br>in your black winter coat, heavily scarved,
<br>and we paused. Approvingly, you tapped one glove
<br>on my armload—you’d told me to cook more, dictated
<br>recipes. I asked if this had been Pequita’s
<br>choir-practice place; the sentence wavered,
<br>but you replied with grim joy,
<br>“She’s not practicing now.” It took me a minute.
<br>Pequita was singing, this moment, in the Presence.
<br>
<br>Still what you felt most (it was in your face)
<br>was absence, absence, but from something bitter
<br>in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, I felt
<br>your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies.
<br>What were such luxuries now, ironies, Anglo friends;
<br>and I thought you hated my mind
<br>that remembered the brownpapered books,
<br>the orange juice. I reached to touch your arm—to get past
<br>this, but no, you had to get home:
<br>“I fasted for communion”; and your eyes
<br>swerved away. All my laughable,
<br>my lovely, delusional studies, that I’d seen you
<br>sort through for Pequita, were now an affront. And yet
<br>I felt you moving behind your own mind, as if
<br>with something held in reserve ...
<br>
<br>
<br>IX
<br>
<br>
<br>But then you stopped answering the phone, went
<br>less often to church. What I thought
<br>was that you were angry (certainly I was). Perhaps
<br>I thought you needed to talk, and I’d visit you
<br>in Manhattan. So one morning in March,
<br>in the black coat I’d got for the funeral, I walked east
<br>from the forty-second street Lexington stop
<br>to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium
<br>of the Tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor,
<br>where you started. There was a cart in the hall,
<br>
<br>a gleaming chrome maid’s cart half-projecting
<br>from a bedroom. On its sides were rows
<br>of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold-
<br>stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. It moved out,
<br>and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat
<br>in a starchy pink uniform monogrammed
<br>PILAR. When you saw me, you dropped the sheets
<br>and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks,
<br>and looked at me looking at you. When
<br>I started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me
<br>to the elevator. Pressed the button, stepped back,
<br>and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug
<br>before pushing me in.
<br>
<br>
<br>X
<br>
<br>
<br>It had been always this half-connected
<br>and tenuous, our friendship. What light on my own
<br>isolation and need, that I hadn’t known.
<br>But you actually called me, that week, to propose
<br>our old joke, a bridge walk—maybe Saturday?
<br>Your voice in my ears sounded wobbly
<br>with tension, held-backness, so I got in first:
<br>a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me
<br>a minute Village studio starting June ... After that
<br>I could listen, somber, as you poured out
<br>your need to leave, Luz’s cousin, the possible
<br>hotel job “right in LA.” You added “Anne,” and broke off.
<br>“Well, I’ll tell you that later. Look, it may
<br>snow on Saturday, OK?” “I don’t care.” And before
<br>
<br>you hung up, I’d resigned you,
<br>given you up. We’d part, on my side
<br>in anger, on yours in oblivion. I met you
<br>at the foot of the anchorage stair
<br>(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade
<br>near the ramp site). We climbed through the snow,
<br>slowly, pausing at landings for different
<br>views of our old alley world. Like a museum
<br>of disused urban functions—we noted a bricked-over
<br>backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct,
<br>of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. The whole scene
<br>thrown out of drawing by one of those giant
<br>NYC cable-spools, charred at the bottom
<br>where some homeless had tried to burn it.
<br>
<br>The moist snow was sweeping
<br>through the cable tower when we clambered
<br>onto the path beneath it. As we moved, hunched slightly,
<br>onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly
<br>whited-out to a monochrome geometry
<br>of vertical and stooping gray lines. I thought
<br>how Pequita would have loved it, and caught
<br>her mother’s eye. We went on cautiously, soon
<br>pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail
<br>at the traffic lanes below us. “Anne, what
<br>I started to say before—this is it: I’m sorry
<br>I didn’t talk to you—you understand?” “Of course,”
<br>I lied aimlessly. But you, glancing sideways,
<br>“But I’m really sorry ...” “No, really ...” You shook
<br>your head slightly, then took my arm. “Okay then—
<br>what’s this thing?” pointing a snowy boot
<br>at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal
<br>nut: “It’s just a bolt.” You tapped your glove on a strut—
<br>“strut,” I provided. And you said, pompously, in Luz’ very
<br>intonations (in what spirit had you
<br>listened?)—“The tolerances just aren’t there.”
<br>
<br>Then, feeling easier, we started naming everything—
<br>spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: English,
<br>Spanish, and then I heard you speak Quiché (words once
<br>for vines, for split trunks
<br>over gorges?) But everything on the bridge was
<br>shabby, neglected-looking; and you said
<br>soberly: “If anyone was supposed
<br>to look after this bridge, he’s forgot all about it.”
<br>We didn’t link arms again, but started back, pausing
<br>to throw a few loose snowballs
<br>on the Manhattan traffic below us. We’d go
<br>our separate ways—I’d go on delaying, skirting
<br>around my burnt-out places; you’d go
<br>where you could, forget what you could—
<br>some Job-like relinquishment of inquiry
<br>or thought; organisms tend to persist ... When
<br>we got down to the massive base
<br>of the anchorage, we managed a hug
<br>that took in our past, at least: one embrace
<br>of two black winter coats in the snow.

<br> I
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> It was a dying sun, too. 
<br> 
<br> The sun did not have the energy it had two hours ago, nor in some 
<br> 
<br> days last June, 
<br> 
<br> But it was the same sun, with the same distances. 
<br> 
<br> —Was it the sun in black water 
<br> 
<br> On an Eighth Avenue pavement? 
<br> 
<br> What else could it be? 
<br> 
<br> The sun was allotting itself to ever so many dark, watery surfaces; 
<br> 
<br> I guess, being the sun, it could do nothing else.
<br> 
<br> But it was a miracle, a miracle being that you can look at, with amazement inhabiting what you look with.
<br> 
<br> Certainly, it was before, but there was something like amazement 
<br> 
<br> when the sun (they say it is millions of miles away) was, 
<br> 
<br> through its light, in the consequences of a February rainfall 
<br> 
<br> and snowfall at once, with warmth present. 
<br> 
<br> The sun was in February slush. 
<br> 
<br> If this is not something to be amazed at, 
<br> 
<br> Let us consult the most incredible lives of saints, 
<br> 
<br> Written carelessly, 
<br> 
<br> And call ourselves not careful.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> II
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> The sunlight was like a true saint, a factual saint, 
<br> 
<br> As it took up residence in slush. 
<br> 
<br> The sunlight was like a beneficent mediaeval visitation 
<br> 
<br> As it took up discernible residence in a puddle. 
<br> 
<br> One puddle, along with the sun, had clouds in it
<br> 
<br> As plain as anything: 
<br> 
<br> Grey, rotund, white vagueness within a puddle of water.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> III
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> It is necessary to say what sunlight in slush bodes. 
<br> 
<br> Offhand, it seems hard to think it bodes anything but well. 
<br> 
<br> Slush (undesirable) is visited with power by February sunlight (desirable) 
<br> 
<br> And the slush has it that way, by the nature of slushness.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> IV
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Slush is of various kinds, 
<br> 
<br> Puddles are of various kinds. 
<br> 
<br> Black wet areas on pavements 
<br> 
<br> Are of various kinds: 
<br> 
<br> But the February sunlight was present in all the kinds that came 
<br> 
<br> to be on Eighth Avenue below Fourteenth Street the day I'm

<br> The sunlight was present, even, in a furrow a car had made. 
<br> 
<br> Sunlight gets into vehicular furrows and can be recorded as being 
<br> 
<br> in furrows.

<br> The hardware store looked on. 
<br> 
<br> Pizza selling went on near the visitation of slush by sunlight, and dwelling therein. 
<br> 
<br> Sanctity can come to pizzas 
<br> 
<br> As you think of sunlight—fading but there—in slush, some of it 
<br> 
<br> with long oblong furrows.

<br> 
<br> While sunlight—dying sunlight— 
<br> 
<br> Can come to slush, 
<br> 
<br> We can't be sure 
<br> 
<br> What can visit us, 
<br> 
<br> What can occur to us; 
<br> 
<br> What we are in a world of light without end 
<br> 
<br> And possible slush ready to show itself, too— 
<br> 
<br> In a world where both light and slush are indefatigable, and, are
<br> 
<br> often friendly in February.

<br>She is perfectly ordinary, a cashmere scarf
<br>snugly wrapped around her neck. She is
<br>a middle age that is crisp, appealing in New York.
<br>She is a brain surgeon or a designer of blowdryers.
<br>I know this because I am in her skin this morning
<br>riding the bus, happy to be not young, happy to be
<br>thrilled that it is cold and I have a warm hat on.
<br>Everyone is someone other than you think
<br>under her skin. The driver does not have
<br>a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in his metal 
<br>lunchbox. He has caviar left over from New Year’s
<br>and a love note from his mistress, whom he just left
<br>on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 14th Street.
<br>When she steps off his bus to take over the wheel
<br>of the crosstown No. 8, she knows she is anything
<br>but ordinary. She climbs under the safety bar
<br>and straps the belt on over her seat. She lets
<br>the old lady who is rich but looks poor take her time
<br>getting on. She lets the mugger who looks like
<br>a parish priest help her. She waits as we sit, quiet 
<br>in our private, gorgeous lives.
