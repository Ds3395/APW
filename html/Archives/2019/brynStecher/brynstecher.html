	<h1> What I Did </h1>
	<p> At first, my project was a image carousel of a series of puppy images. With this portion of my project, I learned a lot about how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together. I also learned a lot about how to import images and assigning buttons to have certain roles. </p>

	<p>
		However, I recently changed my project to be how I present my work for my independant study, which is an archive on mapping the poets of New York City. I have learned how to make a tab bar, have three levels of a dropdown menu, and differentiate the background from an image. This is the platform I will be using for the rest of the year. I have never learned as much programming in a short amount of time as with this project and I fully understand all of my code!

		I plan to learn a new language, make a fractal, and make a game.
