<p>    For this project I added a web page that had two different animations. In order to 
 create this project I learned how to embed a javascript file from P5 into my html website.
 From this project I was able to explore P5 and through doing so learn more about Javascript
 in general. I also began experimenting with some of the add ons for P5 like their 3d canvas.
 As of now I am working on adding a 3rd animation to my current web page that is in 3d. I think
 I want to continue working in P5 and experimenting with some of the libraries they have 
 available to use. I also had been interested in working with building a 3d printer as my next
 project in programming.</p>
