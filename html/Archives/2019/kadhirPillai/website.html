I made a fan page for Kadhir because I think it's important for all of us to be able to show our appreciation for Kadhir. 

I learned that javascript really isn't that hard to program in. It's pretty simple to embed photos or even games and videos from websites. I also learned that sometimes GitHub can take A LONG TIME to process my requests/updates.

I think I'll continue adding to my webpage or make a new webpage. I want the page to showcase all of the games that I have make over the years. I might also make a new game after that.
