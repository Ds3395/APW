		<h1>Answers to Questions A and B!</h1> <!--"changed title" -->
         <h3> Answers to questions:
a. For this class project I created a basic page modeled of Golanka's original code. I started this class/project not knowing anything about git hub or sublime. In the end I learned basic techniques like how to create a comment, how to format the page using a header or body text, and to add a sound to the document under a button. While I did spend a lot of time doing each of the beginner/moderate tasks I believe that I learned a lot in the process and now understand the basic functions for GitHub!
B. For my next project I hope to tackle the harder elements on GitHub and sublime. My goal is to embed an image or website and learn what to do in order to transfer code from processing and create games/ put games on my site as well. I think I will work on a different project and link it to my current page and I most likely want to change the theme of my page to make it more of a accessible/directory document instead of the main page. </h3>
