<h2>March 2021 - Advice for Working on the Main Page</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue"> This is most likely the last time I will attempt working on the main page. I attempted to add a new section but it seems like there is some javascript to write in that I do not know how to write. For anyone who attempts to change the main site in the future: do know that it is quite hard to move the dynamic examples. I am sure there is a way to write above them, but below them does not seem to work in the slightest. Also, please find a way to make the Trevor-colored footer an easier divider for sections on the page. I tried to use them to make a 'Meet A Student' section but the footers have sectioning issues. </p>

<h2>February 2021 - Work on the Main Page</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue"> I have been working on the main page of this site. That has been going fairly well despite the fact that I have not done something like this in a while. I was also considering picking up my project with Leila from last year </p>

<h2>January 2021 - Color Palette Generator</h2>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS9-hhYKG7dsyVnaAf-wYUvbeNfwu4KXJ2SkUyYNb-e2XhUxB5g6zQNQXQjCG6dCnqLxZg4SrVJyh5h/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My most recent project is a random color palette generator. I presented on it as well as the history of colors in the programming world. My presentation should be above this text. For the generator, I used JavaScript as well as HTML to make it. It creates a randomly generated, non-coordinated palette of 5 different colors. I have finally gotten the hex codes to show without breaking the generator. To expand off what I have done so far, I could find a way to get the colors of the palettes to actually aesthetically fit together. I will be doing so for my coding program outside of school, as I plan to present this to them.</p>

<h2>June 2020 - Translator</h2>

<p style="color:darkslateblue">My project was a English to Spanish/Spanish to English translator in Python. I worked on this project with Leila last year. We used dictionary APIs from Merriam Webster to create a translator that will take a word in one language and translate it to the other language. As an expanding point from that, we would have started to try and make our translator translate whole sentences or phrases.</p>
