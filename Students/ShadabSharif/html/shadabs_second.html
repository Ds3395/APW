<h1>Welcome to my second page!</h1>

<h2>10/14/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>From the previous classes until today, I've been working on my main website. In order to do that, I rekindled some of my old javascript skills using p5.js and looked at some of my previous projects, and edited them to fit the website. I also had to relearn a bit of HTML. I went through some trouble pushing my file onto the website, but overall there were no major issues and it went as smooth as coding can go.  </p>
<p>From now on, I'll start working on my project. Right now, I don't have a clear idea on what I want to work on. I want to do something a little interesting like facial recongition or voice recongition and connect it to something tangible like voice activited lights or facial recongition notebook page turner. On the other hand, I might want to do a discord bot. I'm going to experiment and research certain ideas in order to see what will be the best fit for me. </p>
<h2>10/21/2021 Thursday</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teach back topic to Thunkable, a website/app builder without HTML or css code. I learned about this around 2 years ago at a hackathon at Riverdale and I sort wanted to highlight the pros/cons of using a app/website builder like this aswell as the limits of it. Also, Nathan and I decided on our topic which would be making a computer teach itself on how to play brick breaker. Nathan started a github repository and I forked it so that we can upload all of the changes we make.</p>
<h2>10/28/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my teachback topic again. This time, I changed it to github copilot because I saw one of my friends use it and I thought it was interesting. I recently got access to the same program and it has been very fun and pretty intuitive. I finally created the local files from the forked project of Nathan's project and I starting make changes from my side and made sure it worked. I went through the same process that I went through for APW1. I also updated my side of the github file so that my version was the same as the original one.</p>
<h2>11/4/2021</h2>
<p>TThis week, I developed a bit of my teach back topic through starting a slideshow and messing around a bit with Github Copilot so that I can learn about it a bit more. I started working a bit more on the AIBrickbreaker project by trying to figure out how to make the bricks for the game with specific properties, and I kinda have an idea on how to do it but I'm not completely sure how to go about it.</p>
<h2>11/12/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I worked on the ball function but I struggled a bit because I am getting back into python. I also started to understand how the game is suppoused to work by working with Nathan. Nathan sent me a video and started explaining it. He sent me a picture and I tried to visualize it through a notebook drawing. Overall, I didn't do to much on the project but I spent more time trying to understand what we were doing, so that it will help me code the project for the future. </p>
<h2>11/19/2021</h2>
<p>This week I watched many videos on how other people made A. I programmed games as well as Deep Learning A.I programmed games. It was interesting to look at how the computer sort of learns how to play and how it memorizes certain algorithms and patterns to help it play out. I also kept working on our ball class in our program and possibly thought about making our game in unity to try out a new program as well as to make it a bit easier on ourselves.</p>
<h2>12/2/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I started my teachback project and finished the presentation so I am prepared to present for next week. My presentation is on A.I coding and how A.I can code for you and I learned a bit more about GPT-3 when talking to Mr. Lindow and through a bit of research during class. I am still working on the ball class and spoke with Nathan about hoping to finish the ball class and slider class by the end of winter break with the hopes of it being fully functional.</p>
<h2>12/9/2021</h2>
<p>This week I presented my teach-back project of A. I Coding through Github Copilot and OPENAI Codex. I messed around with the two programs a bit more to see the limitations and functions of each of the programs to see how intuitive they are. From what I've seen, Github Copilot imports more and has better comments but has more errors. OpenAI Codex, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated but hardcodes most of the information which makes it difficult to work with because it is completely hit or miss of what you want it to code. I am still working on the ball class and I still have the hopes to finish the ball and slider class by the end of winter break.</p>
<h2>12/17/2021</h2>
<p>This week, I did some things in my ball and slider classes but I mostly wanted to do a bit of testing with github copilot to see how it would rewrite the code I already wrote. I am planning out what I should write for each of the classes and I have comments in the code to help me when I do start writing it I just need to get around to writing it.</p>
<h2>1/28/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I struggled to upload my original edited APW1 but I hope this time it worked. Unfortunately, I lost my original text that I wrote but it's ok. This week, I've been focusing on finding a new topic and I've been seeing a bunch of videos on A.I generated Art based on a key word. I'm still not sure what to do my new topic on because A.I generated Art might take too long and it might be a bit too difficult for what Nathan and I are able to acocomplish. I learned a lot from my previous AIBrickBreaker project. I was able to finish the BrickBreaker portion of the game, but I was not able to do the AI part because it was too complicated. I sort've understood it, but I was not able to replicate it. I've also seen many other people try to do the same thing Nathan and I tried to do, but they all did it slightly differently which was interesting. Overall, I learned a lot about A.I and it is as challennging as I thought it would be!</p>
<h2>2/4/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I edited the names of my files to follow the name format correctly. Then, I ressearched a lot about A.I art and the creation of it and how it works. It searches the web for images relating to the prompt you give and meshes a bunch of common colors and patterns within a bunch of images, and puts them all together. I realized how hard it was because I watched a bunch of other people's videos on how they created A.I art websites and that this idea is fairly new but not exactly original. I'm still trying to work out how I'm going to make my website original or unique, or I might just do an entirely new idea.</p>
<h2>2/11/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I watched a ton of videos on A.I art and decided to temporarily switch my topic to ASCII art because I feel as though it would be more manageable and I understood it a lot more than A.I Art. Also, the process of recongizing a ton of images and recreating your own image would be helpful when I do work on my A.I art creation program/project. It would be a first step towards A.I art and it would make a ton easier to understand!</p>
<h2>2/18/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I watched a few more videos on A.I Art, but to be honest, I didn't do too much this week. Nathan also sent me a few videos on A.I Music as well, and it seems pretty interesting but I'm not sure how to approach that topic well because I am not used to it and I've never heard of it. I'm gonna explore that in the next coming days and learn more about it.</p>
<h2>2/25/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I started working on my ASCII art generation project. I also did a bit more research on a few general steps or guidelines I should take in order to complete my project, and I found that these 4 steps can be used as some basic instructions : Load an image, Resize Image, Convert image to GreyScale, Convert GreyScale data of each pixel into respective ASCII character. I'm pretty sure I've done the first three in a project last year, so I'm going to use that project to give myself a refresher on how to do the project if I get stuck. At the same time, I probably don't want to use the same code I used for my last year assignment because I want to be able to do it in a different way. I'm going to try to get some part of the first few steps done before the break or within a few weeks.</p>
<h2>3/3/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I am about half way done with the ASCII art project. I am working on making sure it is a bit more interactive and I am working on the file foundation aspect of it. I am trying to make sure that it is able to find the files I want it to. I want it to ask the user what file they want to open so that it is a bit more interactive and intuitive. Currently, it doesn't do it that well, but I am working on it. I am also working on the format of the file pathing construction because I am a bit confused by it myself and it would be helpful to give an example so that users will know what to plug in.</p>
<h2>3/11/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I pretty much finished my ASCII art project, I am just working on making it look better within the Pycharm Output window. I was thinking about trying the code in Visual Studio Code or even with my Terminal to see how it would look there. I was thinking I probably have find a way to keep the aspect ratio while also making the image look nice, probably extending the width and the length of the image. Currently, the image looks shrinked and it's hard to tell its an actual ASCII replication of the image. You can sort of tell, but you have to obsereve it closely. I want to make the replication of the image seamless and very clear.</p>
<h2>4/1/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I looked up other people's ASCII projects to compare their results to mine and there are a few differences. First off, their lines seem like they have smaller spaces in between them. Their lines also look way wider. I found out the reason it looks like this is because the resolution they set the image in is way different compared to mine and also their results are super zoomed out. Once the text file is super zoomed out, it is much easier to see the original image as the text image. Once I figure this out, my project should be finished!</p>
<h2>4/8/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I didn't do much because I have 2 field trips, filling up my entire week!</p>
<h2>4/15/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I started and finished my A.I Art Teachback. After I present it, I will continue to work on my ASCII project and probably rewrite a lot of the code or focus on the dimension calculations so that I can finish it before May ends. </p>
<h2>4/22/2022</h2>
<p> This week, I was suppoused to present my A.I Art Teachback, but we had Parent-Teacher Conferences. I am hoping to present it next week. After that, I will focus on finishing my ASCII project and making sure the output is clearer and more comprehensible. </p>
<h2>4/29/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I was also suppoused to present my A.I Art teachback, but this week I had an essay workshop in the morning on thursday, so I was not able to present. Next week, I will present my A.I Art Project. I haven't had time outside of class to work on my ASCII art project so hopefully next class I will get the chance to present my teachback and work on my ASCII Art project.</p>
<h2>5/5/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I was also suppoused to present my teachback, but I was not able to because there wasn't many people at class today. I am still really busy but I have the majority of the ASCII art project done so hopefully I can just comment it a bit and start doing some self learning outside of class to help myself get better at coding and to finish up the project.</p>
<h2>5/12/2022</h2>
<p>This week, I finished my teachback and presented it (After 1 month of delay!). I am still really busy but I have the majority of the ASCII art project done so hopefully I can just comment it a bit and start doing some self learning outside of class to help myself get better at coding and to finish up the project.</p>
<h2>5/20/2022</h2>
<p>This week, we had nathan's teachback about A.I and game design and seemed pretty intersesting. I'm pretty sure my ASCII project is done and I am thinking about ways to improve it or what new projects I can do for myself or for next year. I was able to fix the aspect ratio for my ASCII project as well as the filename issues so that images in the folder should work and they should look a bit more defined despite it taking it from grayscale. </p>
<h2>5/28/2022</h2>
<p>This week is our 2nd to last class of Programming (I'm pretty sure). I'm pretty sure my ASCII project is done and I am thinking about ways to improve it or what new projects I can do for myself or for next year. I was able to fix the aspect ratio for my ASCII project as well as the filename issues so that images in the folder should work and they should look a bit more defined despite it taking it from grayscale. </p>
<h2>6/2/2022</h2>
<p>This week is our last class of Programming (I'm pretty sure). I'm pretty sure my ASCII project is done and I am thinking about ways to improve it or what new projects I can do for myself or for next year. I was able to fix the aspect ratio for my ASCII project as well as the filename issues so that images in the folder should work and they should look a bit more defined despite it taking it from grayscale. </p>
