		<p style="font-size:20px;">I updated the roster on the website for this section. I have the changes saved locally because I am waiting to upload them so that we can coordinate across all 3 sections. This year, I plan to take a course in either C# or Javascript, or create plugins for games.</p>
		<div style="font-size:20px;">
			<p><b>10/8:</b> Coming up with ideas on what types of plugins to make. I will probably make some sort of a chat filter.</p>
			<p><b>10/15:</b> Figuring out what application I will use to create these plugins. I wasn't able to get too much done this week as I had a lot of work and college essays to write. I hope to get more done next week.</p>
			<p><b>10/22: </b>I will use Visual Studio for my project this year. I have started looking at some code other programmers have used to get an idea of how I want to frame my program.</p>
			<p><b>10/29:</b> I didn't get much done this week because I was finishing and submitting all of my college applications. Next week, I will be able to accomplish more.</p>
			<p><b>11/5: </b>Testing other developers' code so that I can understand how they did it and implement it into my own program.</p>
			<p><b>11/12: </b>This past week was very busy for me so I wasn't able to accomplish much. Next week will allow me to get more done.</p>
			<p><b>11/19: </b>Experimenting with different methods of filtering chat and different bypasses.</p>
			<p><b>12/3: </b>I've started compiling a list of terms to use for my game plugin. I will probably look for a list online that I can reference to make it easier.</p>
			<p><b>12/10: </b>I didn't get much done this week because I had midterms and essays due, but I will be able to get more done next week because many assignments were already due.</p>
			<p><b>12/17: </b>I worked on my programs and kept implementing new code to see how it worked.</p>
			<p><b>1/28: </b>I created a command using another developer's libraries to see how many warns a player has on a given server. I had originally wanted to make my own plugins from the start, but I have recently realized that it is quite difficult to compile working libraries from scratch as a beginner.</p>
			<p><b>2/4: </b>I used excel to generate over a thousand lines of commands using a certain formula. I used functions such as =concat. After compiling the commands, I inputted them into a MYSQL database Query* to auto fill in a table instead of doing it by hand.</p>
			<p><b>2/11: </b>I didn't get much done on my project this week as I had a lot of tests/other work. I did, however, complete the new formatting for all of my files. I will get more work done next week.</p>
			<p><b>2/19: </b>I worked on another function of the filter plugin where I added the ability to punish offline players. I have not fully tested it, so I do not know if it works. No errors have arisen in the console so I believe it was a success.</p>
			<p><b>2/25: </b>I tested new code from another developer which I will try to implement into my own program.</p>
			<p><b>3/4: </b>I didn't get much done this week as I was very busy with assessments and other work for next week.</p>
			<p><b>3/11: </b>I continued working on the function that allows a person to check the punishments of offline players and if need be further punish them.</p>
