<p style="font-family: courier"> <p>Ella and I ran into a seemingly never-ending list of errors while doing our project. Our concept was to create a Mod for Minecraft and we looked through various tutorials to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First we downloaded the Java Developer Kit (version 8), which lets us mod on Minecraft in Eclipse. Next, we had to download software to set up our text editor. We downloaded the Eclipse IDE. We had to first launch the Eclipse installer to then install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, since Java is the language used in Minecraft. My computer crashed while running the Eclipse installer and attempting to download Eclipse IDE, for whatever reason, but I just tried downloading it again and it worked. Then we downloaded the 1.12.2 version of Minecraft Forge, which lets us mod Minecraft 1.12.2, and versions beyond it. The version of Forge we used was Mod Development Kit (MDK) for 1.12.2. We unzipped the folder and created a new copy of it, which would become our project folder. The next software we installed was Pinta, which is a program that lets us change the look of the Sword texture in Minecraft. My version of Pinta, despite following a tutorial we found online, ended up being completely in Spanish. After troubleshooting this for a while and trying to re-download it, I gave up and just navigated the app in Spanish. Next we launched Eclipse and imported our project folder. We ran into more issues on this step since some of the software was outdated and no longer supported on my computer. After importing my project folder, there were many errors that appeared on my Eclipse workspace that Mr. Lindow tried to help me work through by researching them. There were also files missing from my project folder, so I went back several steps and redownloaded the Minecraft Forge, but this proved unsuccessful, and there were still missing files. I ran into more issues at the beginning of this process than Ella did, so we worked primarily from her computer over FaceTime. While Ella was importing the forge practice folder into the eclipse workspace she received an error message that said: &ldquo;could not run build action using Gradle distribution.&rdquo; We looked up what this error meant and found that this was due to an error connecting to the Gradle build system. There was no clear answer on how to resolve this issue so after some trial and error we decided to try and find another tutorial. We looked through other websites and read through a booklet, but none of the tutorials were detailed enough or able to teach us how to create a mod. We decided to retry and continue with the original tutorial. We downloaded other Gradle files and updated the build ship application in eclipse from her compute, but it was unsuccessful. Ella tried downloading a different version of forge practice but somehow also lacked the files needed to continue with the tutorial. She later had the same error with the Gradle system pop up, yet she hadn&rsquo;t changed anything. We discussed that, while frustrating, it would be a better use of our time to switch to another project where we could make more progress. We have decided to instead build an Arduino remote control car. To do so, we plan to each order our own separate parts and coordinate to build together over Facetime.</p>

<p><strong>Update for 1/15:</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;To build my Tumbller V1.1 remote control robot car I ordered a kit I found on Amazon. First I screwed two motor brackets into an aluminum alloy board using Pan head machine screws. Then I screwed the motors into the motor bracket using Countersunk Screws. I made sure that the motor shaft was pointed down for both motors. I then screwed Round head Philips screws into two couplings and fit them onto the motor shaft. I then slid the tires onto the couplings and screwed them in. Next I screwed Double-pass copper columns into a foothold with Pan head machine screws and attached it to the aluminum alloy board. Then I fit a 1XGY-521 module onto an expansion board. To put the expansion board on top of the base of the car I screwed in Double-pass copper columns onto the aluminum alloy board and slid the expansion board into the columns. I the fit an ultrasonic sensor into the expansion board. Next I screwed in Single-pass copper pillars with Pan head machine screws into the corners of the alloy board. After that I took K-type gear nuts and Pan head machine screws and attached a lithium battery box to a plastic fastener. I placed the fastener on top of the Single-pass copper pillars and looped the wires through a slot in the fastener. I layered the Top plate on top of the fastener using Double-pass copper cylinders and Pan head machine screws. Then I attached two separate 6P cables from the ports to their corresponding motors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since my kit only arrived on Wednesday, I just finished building the car. For the next couple weeks I will work on learning how to control it and possibly program it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Semester Update:</strong> This semester, Ella and I initially intended to create a mod for minecraft that would adjust the color of various objects, but after hours and hours of unsuccessful work, we decided to pick a new project. While in the process however, we definitely learned a lot about the software used in many video games. Some software that we used was Java Developer Kit (version 8), Eclipse IDE, 1.12.2 version of Minecraft Forge, Mod Development Kit (MDK) for 1.12.2, and Pinta. The tutorial we followed at first was rather outdated, which is most likely why we seemed to run into different issues on every single step. Even though we tried using other tutorials, nothing really seemed to work. While it was incredibly frustrating that we had put so much time into troubleshooting and in the end were unsuccessful, we definitely both learned a lot, and it was cool to be on the developing side of Minecraft, since I used to play it when I was younger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we discussed switching projects with both Mr. Lindow and Mr. Golanka, Ella suggested that we build this robotic remote control car that she had seen online. We ordered our own parts from Amazon and sometimes coordinated to build it together over FaceTime. The kit was a little confusing to maneuver through at times since the packages weren&apos;t really clearly labeled and the instructions that came with the kit did not actually describe what it is that you had to do. While the process of building the car was somewhat tedious and an area of &quot;engineering&quot; that neither of us had had previous exposure in, we both managed to build it and for the past week have been playing with the controls and learning about how to move it. I just downloaded an app a couple days ago that allows you to control its movement from your phone. We hope to continue to work on this and possibly program its movement.</p>
<p><br></p><strong>Next Semester Plan Update:&nbsp;</strong>As of now, Ella and I plan on continuing and further developing our previous project of building a robot car from an Elegoo Set. To do so, we plan on programming the expansion board through using Arduino software on our computers. My kit with the supplies that I had previously ordered in order to make the car itself was missing the cable required to connect the computer to the expansion board, so I have been trying to locate one online that I can order. We have found a couple tutorials using the Arduino software, but are yet to settle on a specific goal we want to achieve, mainly because we aren&apos;t quite sure of what we can do just yet.</p>

<p><strong>Update for 2/26</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This week Ella and I began to try to program our Tumbller cars. First I installed the Arduino IDE. Next I made sure that my library for Arduino had the Bridge Library. I learned how to import a .zip library and manually install libraries as well. As of now we did not need to add any libraries to our Arduino application. Next I selected the port and serial monitor. We made sure the serial monitor ws set to 9600 baud and was on autoscroll. We tried to complete Lesson 2 Blink, which is a part of &quot;The Most Complete Starter Kit for UNO.&quot; However, Ella and I both ran into issues when trying to upload the code from our computers to the board in the car. After researching, we came to the conclusion that this has to do with an error with the port, as I have to use a cable and an adapter, or with the computer being a Mac.</p>

<p><strong>Update for 3/12</strong></p>
<p>Ella and I have been playing with our cables to try and fix the issue, but so far have been unsuccessful. We tried to work through the issue with Mr. Lindow in class. I tried updating my computer, but my Arduino application kept crashing. I tried restarting my computer with the cable and adapter plugged into my computer, but it still did not seem to read the cable, as no new options appeared under the cable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Update 4/9/21</strong></p>
<p>Ella and I have been playing with different cables in the hopes of the computer finally connecting to the board attached through the cables, but so far we have been unsuccessful. We plan to meet with Mr. Golanka next week and brainstorm some ways to fix this issue. As we have not been able to progress on the programming aspect, I have been playing with the app that controls the car and learning more about how to move it. &nbsp;</p>

<strong>Update for 4/24</strong><br><br>My computer is still getting repaired so I have not been able to progress on the programming but I have been playing with it through the app.<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Update 5/7</strong></p>
<p>I am picking up a loaner laptop from school tomorrow and Ella and I plan to meet with Mr. Golanka sometime next week to collaboratively work on programming the robot. I believe we will first try installing the Blink command.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5/21:</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I just got my loaner computer and tested it with the Arduino, however it did not connect. I am going to keep trying next week by reinstalling the application.</p>
