		For my contribution to the class website project, I created my own page where I did some expirementing with html. I learned some of the basics of html and how to complete the process of submitted my changes, and recieving other classmate's changes.

		For my project, I'd like to make a multiplayer game. I would first learn some basics of C# and how to use the software "Unity". I'd like to recreate / make something similar to a game called League of Legends. It is third person with the camera looking down upon your character. Here is some example gameplay footage: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4QG59y6FGE" target="_blank">League of Legends gameplay.</a> It's a 5 versus 5 fight where the goal is to destroy the enemy's base. There are turrets that block your path though. They will shoot you if you get too close. Small computer controlled characters called "minions" will walk towards the turrets and take the damage for you while you destroy it. The enemy will also have minions so you have to kill the enemy's and push before they do the same. You can choose a character to play as, each one having unique abilities. You gain gold by killing minions and other players, which you can use to buy items that will make you stronger.
	</p>

	<p>
		I think making a smaller version of this could be a fun challenge for me. I like 3D modeling as well as coding so this project could combine two things I enjoy which would motivate me to work on it more often. Some goals I have for this project would be to make at least 6 unique characters so that there is a small selection to choose from which might make it feel more complete. I'd also like to be able to send this to, and play it with some friends. My main goal by the end of this project is to be able to confidently code in C#.

		<b>Week 1:</b> <br> For the first week of working on my project, I installed and setup unity on my computer. I found a very long and in depth course that I can do to learn the ins and outs of unity along with a good amount of C#.
		<a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2020.3" target="_blank"> Here is a link to the course</a>. I have been watching the videos and I'm on unit 1.2 so far. I will continue to go through the course over the weekend.

	<p>
		<b>Week 2:</b> <br> This week I continued to follow the unity course and I've become decently familiar and comfortable with the user interface. Now that I'm familiar with the interface, I've begun the parts of the lesson with C# coding. This weekend I plan to set up a unity collaborate thing that will let me work on the same project on a different computer. Unity is quite slow and laggy on my macbook so I hope to start mainly working on it on my PC at home. I also have blender installed on my PC that I can use to do some basic modeling for my game later on.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 3 | October 29:</b> <br> This week I continued to follow the unity course and have continued to become more familiar with C#. I also started to focus on working on my teachback project about multiplayer games and how they work. I have done some research and I've put some information in a google slideshow. Over the weekend I will continue to work on the slideshow and follow the course on Unity.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 4 | November 5:</b> I followed the tutorial some more this week and worked on my teachback presentation in class. I am nearly finished with the teachback presentation and I think I was able to get some interesting facts on it. By the end of next week I should have completed the first full unit of the tutorial and will have completed a full game in unity and c#!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Week 5 | November 12:</b> This week I continued working on my teachback project and kept going through the unity tutorial. I still am having some troubles with pushing my changes so I hope to meet with you during class next week on finding a solution.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Week 6 | Noveber 19:</b> I have pretty much completed my teachback project presentation so I am almost ready to present for my upcoming due date. I am continueing to work on, and am nearing the end of the unity tutorial. This week I was also able to fix my problem with my github login.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 7 | December 3:</b> This week I finished my teachback presentation and I'm ready to present for my upcoming due date. This weekend I won't be able to work much because I'm away from home, but during next week I hope to start nearing the end of my Unity tutorial, and hopefully start working on my game.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 8 | December 11th:</b> I was not able to do very much last week because of a busy weekend and a track meet mid way through. Going into next week and winter break though, I hope to be able to finish up my Unity Tutorial and start working through the code in my project. I plan on getting a lot of work done over the break.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 9 | December 16th:</b> I presented my teach-back project this week in class. The winter break is beginning tomorrow. I plan to get a lot of work done over the break. I am not going anywhere so I should have a lot of time to do some coding. I hope to explore something on Unity that allows me to share my files between my mac and my pc at home. My mac has trouble running the game but hopefully my PC will run it better, making it easier to test.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 10 | January 28th:</b> After doing the discord bot as a short break from my project, I have become more revitalized and feel more ready to restart the project. I've done some research and created some very simple models for the game. I'm changing it to 2D instead of 3D and making it more of a repetitive arcade game with highscores rather than a full fledged game with an ending and everything.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 11 | February 4th:</b> I did some research and found a bunch of mini tutorials for how to create a 2D multiplayer game using unity. I've begun to flesh my idea out a little bit better. I'm planning on using an old school type retro 8-bit artsyle because it is much easier and much less time consuming than highly detailed art. I am learning how to make a sprite sheet and how to animate the sprite in unity at the moment. I plan on working on the background art and starting to work on the movement over the weekend and through next week.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 12 | February 10th:</b> I started the simple artwork for my characters. I'd like to create them using Adobe Photoshop, but I do not own it. I want to know exactly what characters and what objects I will need so that I am able to make everything I'll use for the project in the 7 day free trial that I can get.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Week 13 | February 19th:</b> I followed some tutorials online and have created a good base for my game. I've yet to do much coding, but I feel that I have a very good start. I plan to start coding over the next week and watch some more videos about how to set up a multiplayer game.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 14 | February 24th:</b> Just working on coding and movement. Most of my stuff I do at home on my PC because I was able to salvage and re-use some code from my scrapped project that I was working on there. I might do some extra more tomorrow because of service day giving me some free time. For now I don't have much new stuff to talk about.
	</p> 

	<p>
		<b>Week 15 | March 3rd:</b> It's been and is going to be a busy buildup to winter break for me. Along with all of my schoolwork, I'm currently preparing for the April 2nd ACT, so I haven't been able to work on my project very much recently. I hope to do some work over winter break and hit the ground running after my ACT - I hope to get a lot of work done after all of my current school work and ACT are over with.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 16 | March 10th:</b> I have continued to translate my old code into something more usable for this new project. I'm still trying to figure out how to implement my own art into a 2D unity game and how to animate a sprite in the correct way. I plan to do the bulk of my project over break, seeing as I won't have any other school work to worry about. For now, however, not much has changed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 17 | April 1st:</b> I did not have my PC over spring break so I couldn't work very much, but I did figure out how to connect the game program code on both my PC and my mac, so I should be able to work on it at school as well. I have all of my ideas for the game fully fleshed out at the moment, and I plan to make a single player version before trying to tackle online multiplayer. I plan on making a quick first version of it after I come back from the junior Washington D.C. trip. I plan on having a character that moves to where the player right clicks. I hope to have obstacles that fly your way that you need to dodge. The difficulty will slowly get harder. I plan on having a settings menu to change the walking speed of your character, speed of flying obstacles, size of obstacles, etc. After making this I will try to add a button that will shoot an obstacle from your character in the direction of your mouse. This won't be usable in single player, but will instead be used in the multiplayer version. While dodging the obstacles, you can try to shoot your opponent who is trying to do the same. I plan on having a survival multiplayer mode where there is no shooting but the obstacle speed goes up over time, and then having a fighting mode where the obstacle speed stays the same but you are able to shoot.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 18 | April 8th:</b> I've begun to prepare for my upcoming teachback project by planning what I want to present. I also had a very annoying problem with my merging / pushing / pulling so I spent the entire class period fixing that with you. There isn't anything new on my game but I hope to work on it some over the weekend.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 19 | April 15th:</b> I have just been working on my teachback project. I think it is coming up either next week or the week after. I hope to have most of it finished by the end of the weekend.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 20 | April 23rd:</b> Nothing much to say for my update this week. I have just been working on my teachback and getting my game into a presentable state.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 21 | April 29th:</b> I finished my teachback and it is ready to present. My presentation date was pushed back though to next week due to me being sick. I plan on starting up some work on my game over the weekend.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 22 | May 6th:</b> My game is at a very basic but playable state. I have the first singleplayer mode working kind of. I would like to improve the game over and it crashes sometimes for reason I do not understand why. I'll look into the problems this weekend.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 23 | May 14th:</b> I presented my teachback this week and continued to do some coding to clean up what I already have made. I have a lot of work coming up so my progress may slow, but I hope to have a complete version of the single player game without the art added yet by the end of this week.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 24 | May 20th:</b> I am just continuing to clean everything up to a presentable state. I have a lot of work with essays and finals, so progress has definitly been slower. I hope to dedicate next week to finishing this project's singleplayer version and then take a small break to study and write essays.
	</p>

	<p> 
		<b>Week 25 | May 26th:</b> I now plan on trying to get my game into a presentable state for next class. I hope to be able to get the game onto my laptop and have it be playable without any glaring errors. I don't have too much work this weekend so I hope to have enough time to do all of that. If not, I can just record some gameplay.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Week 26 | June 5th:</b> I worked some on the game over and the in game score keeper. I made it so that the score per second changes depending on the difficulty. I hope to make the settings menu better soon.
	</p>
