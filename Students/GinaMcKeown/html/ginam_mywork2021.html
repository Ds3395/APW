      <p> <strong> Journal 1: Project Planning </strong><br>

        October 14th, 2021 <br><br>
        I added the students' webpages to the class website navagation bar. I am also starting a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFsB1sq4Pp8CoFx1cvgY3F0lxfPP3eNcDFi2j7_0dV0/edit?usp=sharing">document</a> with some naming and organizational conventions for the future so we can create a system for the APW1 files. Right now the folder is a bit chaotic, and I think with more organization it will be easier to update and it will also work towards preventing merge errors as people simultaneously work on their personal pages. I also started a slack workspace for APW1, which can help us collaborate on different projects. Different hashtags represent different channels and people can be added to those specific or genral channels depending on what they are working on. <br><br>

        In college I am interested in going on a pre-med track, but I would still want computer science and programming to be a part of that, so I've decided to do my teachback on how CS can be used in the medical field. So many different fields have connections to programming now that techonolgy has become an essential tool in life, so I'd be interested to see the possible applictions. <br><br>

        I would like to work on the shared website and a personal project this semester. I'll add the repository once I decide on a project. I am thinking of continuing my cyrptocurrency project from last year, and extending the trading bot to have more complex ways of assessing buying and selling times. Last year, it used the RSI, but this isn't a very good tool for real life purposes, especially on its own.

        October 21th, 2021 <br><br>
        Last year the buying and selling reccommendations were based on past changes with low and high candlesticks, but I think it would be more interesting to work on a method of predicting the future stock changes by finding patterns from the past. And then those future predictions will deterimen when the bot automatically buys and sells. It would also be helpful to have it calculate some form of accuracy, but I am not sure how that would be determined. <br><br>


        The first forumla I found is <a href="https://getmoneyrich.com/how-to-predict-if-a-stock-will-go-up-or-down/">P/E x EPS = Future Price</a><br>
        P/E = Price/Earnings = Price to earning ratio<br>
        EPS = (Net Income - Dividend Payments)/ Weighted Average Outstanding Shares = Earnings per share <br><br>

        One thing I am strugging with is the dropdown content on my navagation bar. I can't get it in the right location. It's in the center but I want it to be right of the Home button. I tried using different floats, but it doesn't change anything except the dropdown content's position. The differences between and functions of float, display, and position are a bit confusing to me.

        October 28th, 2021 <br><br>
        
        As can be seen by the current state of the navagation bar, I still haven't managed to move "My Work" to the right of "Home." I tried going through the details of the css (both the elements that I added and default attributes), but still couldn't figure out why, no matter what I change, it stays in that location (or some other problems occur). It seems so simple!  <br><br>

        Project wise, I am still researching stocks and prediction methods. Also, now that Mr. Lindow has shared the APW1 students' emails, I'll send out a slack invite.

      <p> <strong> Journal 4: Teachback </strong><br>

        November 4th, 2021 <br><br>
        
        Next class, after conference day and two weeks from now, I will be giving my teachback on the ways CS can be applied into the medical field. I have just applied to my ED EA colleges, and I am applying in for chemistry (most likely organic) and hope to double major or minor in computer science. Though I am not sure about what I want to do in the future, pre-med is definetly something I am considering. I know I don't want to major in biology, but chemistry would still align with some of my med school requirements. For some of my essays I wrote about how I want to approach the medical field from a tecnological and chemical perspective, a combination of my interests. <br><br>

        So now my focus has been making my presentation.

       I haven't had much time to work on my programming projects. But I have been continuing to work on my techback, including research and organizing that information.

      Since my teachback was pushed back I spent this week finishing my presentation script and adding key sentences or words to my slides. I also added images.

      December 3rd, 2021 <br><br>
      
      For my project, I am upgrading and extending my project from last year. Earlier, I wrote two seperate programs, one to do the actual buying and selling and recommending, and another with the visual interface. I didn't have the chance to link the two, but that was definetly a goal of mine from last year. So now I am working on figuring out how to sync the two and connect the interactive features of the webapp to the functions in the code. The original code would print out its actions, and text the user, which I want to keep in place. It would work automatically in the background. I hope to keep the automatic feature, while also implementing a manual option when I connect the web app.

      December 9th, 2021 <br><br>
      
      I've taken a break from my project to return to working on my website. After previous editing, there are still some remaining issues and things I want to fix visually. I've returned to wokring on my navbar, which is still out of order and somehow blending into the main pages on the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 pages. Also, I would like to re-do some of the CSS structuring.

      <p> <strong> Journal 9: Slack & File Reorganization Project</strong><br>

      January 28th, 2022 <br><br>

      I have started the Slack workspace, which (hopefully) everyone has joined by now. My goal was to make communication easier and to spread information quickly and a bit more imformally. 
      <br><br>
      I also finished creating indidvidual folders for everyone within the Student folder. So now people won't have to go through a long list of randomly named files to find theirs. 
      <br><br>
      Current work:<br>
      I have now renamed my own files according to the file naming conventions sheet I created. I added the link to the style guide in the Helpful Links section of the homepage navbar. Soon, I will be creating the assignment for everyone to start renaming their own files. 

      <br><br>
      Next Steps:<br>
      <ul>Finish All Renaming</ul>
      <ul>Organize Archived Student Folders</ul>

      Febuary 4th, 2022 <br><br>

      I wrote the assignment for other students to begin renaming their files, so hopefully by the end of this week or next week all of the files will be changed. I'll do the past/archived students myself, but some files are hard to identify and might require some code editing (with images and scripts that are in the html folder rather than seperate folders).
      <br><br>
      I have also decided to do my next teachback on robot surgeons. I plan to discuss the technological and ethical sides of their use.

      Febuary 11th, 2022 <br><br>

      I have been working on my internship at History Lab. I am doing data visualisation with their Freedom of Information Archieve through Tableau. Part of my job is comparing the use of Google Data Studio and Tableau. Earlier, I used data visualization libraries in python to make my covid 19 tracker, so its been very interesting working will higher level tools. It practically no code, and extremely efficent. But you lose of some of the cntrol over the details.

      Now that people are renaming their files there are, as we guessed, some issues arising. So I've been working on fixing the errors and making sure everything remains as it was prior to the trasnistion. Next, I have to rename the graduated seniors files.

      I have been doing research for my teachback, thinking about what specific topics or robots I want to cover in my presentation. I might do a timeine for robots in surgery to show their developemnt and then focus on a few specifc ones I find interesting.

      March 3rd, 2022 <br><br>

      The senior pages from the some years have been organized, but not last year's seniors. So I been working on putting their folders into files. A lot of the files are a bit mixed up and in the wrong folders. I don't think I will rename them accoridng to the new naming conventions, but at least putting them in folders will help organize. In the future, our folders (this year's seniors) will also be going into archieve folders, but this will be easier since we already have out things in individual folders.

        As seniors head off for Spring Break and prepare for Bridge, I have been working on one of my internships that I will continue throughout Bridge. I have been working on data visualization using Google Data Studios and Tableau, organizing data and graphing it to present to my group. Our goal is for researchers, students, and professors to all have easy access to information or data regarding classified govenment documents.
