      <p> For my contribution to the class website project, I added an image that I found online of someone holding a book infront of mountains. What I learned from doing this was how to add an image that I found online to my website. I feel like this is a good foundation for what I want to do for my project. What I have in mind is to make some sort of interactive image where browsers can draw whatever they want on a canvass that I put on the website. I'm not entirely sure how I will do this but I feel like if I can add an image of a plain white screen and have some function where people can interact with it, I can do it. </p> 
      <p> 10/29 Update: For this week's update, I started to download images from the internet that I will use for my project. I also started some of the basic classes.</p>
      <p>11/5 Update: For this week's update, I made a function where moving the mouse while it is being held down will draw. The color of the 'paint' is red but I am working towards making buttons that change the color as well as a button that erases whatever has been drawn.</p>
      <p>11/12 Update: For this week's update, I started a button class that will make it so cliking on different colors will change the color of the brush's ink.</p>
      <p> 11/19 Update: I continued to work on the button class that will change the paint color</p>
      <p> 12/3 Update: I had a lot of major assignments due this week and didn't get the chance to do a lot of work on the project</p>
      <p> 12/10 Update: Continued to work on the button class. I am trying to use some code from another project that utalized buttons</p>
      <p>1/12 Update: Figured out how to make the color switch using buttons. My goals for the end of the term: </p>

      <ol><li>Add remaining color changing buttons</li>
        <li>Make buttons that change the pen size</li>
        <li>Have a button or key that erases the screen completely</li></ol>
    <p>Febuary Updates Part 1: I've been trying to use the first button I made to then make more buttons with different colors and functionalities. However, when I make more buttons, all of my buttons become coppies of the last button I made and they all turn the paint the same color. I'm currently trying to work on making each of my buttons function differently from one another before I start to make buttons that change the size of the pen or a button that clears the screen.</p>
