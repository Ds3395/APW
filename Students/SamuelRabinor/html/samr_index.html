                        You might have noticed this project is labeled as 0 in the list. 
                        That's because this is a project that I started last year during 
                        an independent study! This project originated with a simulation 
                        in which a program my classmates and I were guided through randomly 
                        generated some attributes-<em>strength, health, etc...</em>-for two 
                        characters. It then simulated combat between the two, alternating turns
                        with each character eating food to heal and attacking the other until one 
                        of them died.

                        <br><br>
                        I enjoyed the concept and wanted to expand upon it, so I decided to take 
                        this concept and developed it further, adding a randomized map, character 
                        customization and a lot more. I did not finish the game for reasons explained 
                        in this years project labeled <strong><em>"Learning C++"</em></strong>, however I did 
                        create a large amount of code and framework for the game which can be found on 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Tavnik-7-8-22/Tbag_Python.git" target="_blank">github</a> or you can download the files 
                        <a href="../scripts/Tbag(P).zip" download="Text based adventure game (Python).zip">here</a>.

                        Unfortunately I did not maintain a dev_log during my time coding this project,
                        however I intend to keep one on any future projects I take on!

                        Labeled as 1 in the list, this is the project I intend to take on 
                        this year. As mentioned in the <strong><em>Text based adventure game project</em></strong>,
                        I never fully completed my game in Python. This is due in large part to 
                        how dificult Python is to code with when it comes to game development. Towards 
                        the end of my work on that project I began reaserching different languages that 
                        might facilitate the process of coding my game idea. That is when I discovered C++.
                        <br><br>
                        Attracted by the languages object oriented code and direct memory access, and backed
                        by it's usage in several large companies who work in game development I decided to try
                        and learn it. So far I have used two sources, the first is a playlist of 101 videos by 
                        a youtuber called <em>The Cherno</em>. You can check out his channel by clicking his name, 
                        he has a multitude of playlists on more than just C++, if you want a link to the C++ playlist 
                        you can find that <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&feature=shared"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. The second resource I have used is a variety of courses on a website 
                        called Codecadamy, an online platform with lessons for all programming levels which can be found 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        <br><br>
