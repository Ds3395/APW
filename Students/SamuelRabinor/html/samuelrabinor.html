                My stongest language is python, however I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am learning C++

                This is my second year at Trevor! Up until around a year and a few months ago I was living in Mexico. I grew up there for 16 years before coming here to NYC!

            <p>
                In this past year I have been coding a game in python as a part of an independant study. This year I intend to continue to develop it as well as help out another group of student who approached me with a similar project. Instead of continuing in Python however, I intend to move and continue my project in C# and C++.
