<h2>This is a Work in Progress</h2>
<h3>
  (a) As you saw on the previous page, I made a basic game of tetris as my first APW project.
  The game is still a work in progress, but I am happy with what i was able to ccomplish so far.
  (b) I will most likely finish the Tetris before moving on, but my big project of the year will be to build an online version of Creatr, Archie's and
  My genius invention for a democratized maker solution. To accomplish this to a satifactory quality, we will need good web design, secure web structure,
  a really....attractive GUI, and maybe a domain. We will work on it and see.

<h4>
  week ending Friday 12/11: Frontend rough-up done; database set up, problem with php between sighnup form and SQL querying
</h4>
<h4>
  Week ending Friday 12/18: Still hung up on a bug that either can't form SQL queries or can't send queries to myphp database
</h4>
<h4>

  Week ending Friday 1/08: Still hung up on the problem mentioned previously. New build of HTML and PHP suggests that the problem might not be with the PHP, but with the HTML form.
</h4>
<h4>
  Week ending Friday 1/15: WE DID IT!!!! I DID IT!!!!!! THE BUG IS FIXED, OH YEAH THE BUG IS FIXED! HECK YEAH! WHAT A JOURNEY. AS OF SATURDAY 1/16, I, JACOB WEINGARD, USED NODE.JS ROUTING TO SEND HTML HANDLEBARS FORM DATA TO THE MYSQL SERVER. MORE OF A NAVIGATING AROUND THE PROBLEM THAN AN ACTUAL PROBLEM FIX. OH WELL, THE THING WORKS! I ALSO ADDED(BECAUSE I AM A PSYCHOPATH), 8-TURN PASSWORD HASHING WITH BCRYPTJS, DATABASE QUERYING TO PREVENT REPEAT EMAILS, A PASSWORD CONFIRMATION, AND AN ALMOST-SEXY BOOTSTRAP PRELIMINARY UI. IT IS ALLLLL UPHILL FROM HERE. NOW THAT I'VE SUCCESSFULLY DONE THIS, ISHOULD BE MOSTLY SET TO MAKE THE REST OF THE DATABASE CONNECTIONS. I AM UPLOADING THE PROJECT TO MY GITHUB. WOHOOOOOOOOOOOO. I FEEL LIKE NEO FROM THE MATRIX.

<h4>
  Turns out SQL to Java to HTML parsing is a tad harder than expected. Working on getting profile pages to display custom information based on which user is logged in. another easy add would be adding a second database/HTML form for creating projects.
</h4>

<h4>
  2/26: Started 14 hour tutorial on graphql with reatctjs and express. won't watch whole thing; i can only rebuild from the ground up so many times. I just expect that some of the info will be helpful. Also: Archie is closer to having a functional copy of my code. I really want to get this thing up and running. shame that programming is so hard.
</h4>

<h4>
3/12: This is terrible! I have made NO progress in 2.5-three months. I should call this what it is: I'm code-procrastinating. It is so very awful. I really want to do this thing, but I just haven't for a few weeks. Oh the shame! I will really try to get'r done, but with Archie leaving for bridge soon, I don't know what I will be able to do. I am starting up my super busy college process, so maybe I bit off more than I can chew on my own.

<h4>
  4/10: Began work on teachback topic, familiarizing myself with the C programming language. I will be building a simple project in C to make sure I understand the basics before passing them on. I have also begun to research the history of the language.
</h4>

<h4>
  5/1: Upgraded the Creatr home page to include a beautiful lantern image I made. The image was partially optimized for web viewing.
</h4>
<h4>
  5/7: Nothing new to report this week. Ozan might want to join the Creatr team. I want to get the profile page up and functioning or the project posting fuctional before the year's end. Project posting will be easier.
