<h2>I promise that programming is happening</h2>
<h4>
  10/15: Update 1.5! I am in the thick of the college application process. I am very busy. However, I also waste a lot of time. I figure I have a few hours to lose. I am commiting to two hours per week of my University of Hellsinki open-course webdev sheets. Allons-y!
</h4>
<h4>
  10/27: Update 2! I did about 1.3 hours last week, so not ideal, but I am past the busiest part of this leg of the college process. hopefully, more to come!</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  11/05: Update 3! Did 1.5 hours this week. I plan on doing another half hour this weekend. I don't feel like I learned a lot of applicable information this week. I think it's fine. amybe next week the info will be more applicable</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  11/13: This week I did my teach-back on cybersecurity attacks. I presented several common types of cybersecurity breaches. I think it was a pretty successful presentation. Next week, more Hellsinki coursework!</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  11/19: This week, nothing has happened. So unfortunate! I have been busy and also unproductive. I do plan on doing a little work this Saturday. I will discuss it in next week's installation </ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  12/03: Panic ensued when I tried to code a random chord generator for piano (in python), and I realized that I don't actually know how to code in python anymore. Very tragic. I am working on fixing this, because I refuse to lose a year of knowledge </ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  12/10: I did an hour of web development learning this week, specifically relating to understanding the admin-level setup of a test server. Complicated stuff! </ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  1/28: I did some Arduino programming in preparation for an Engineering project, dusting off the the ol' micrcocontroller skills </ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  2/4: Trevor Maker Lab (my engineering club) blossomed in full force this week! I taught them arduino/circuit fundamentals, and they have been building some great things. Soon we will begin our drone! Combining this with my engineering class, I have done updwards of 5 hours of arduino prototyping this week.</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  2/11: Working on Makerlab stuff and currently building a smoke detector.</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
  2/25: Successfully used a potentiometer as a dial to switch my smoke detector between "set" and "test" modes. Added a physical "reset code" button. Integrated the LCD circuit into the WAV audio sheild arduino. I am having a problem with the way line 2 displays of the LCD, and my sound byte is too long to play, so I will be breaking it up into segments.</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
3/4: Finished my project! Used two arduinos(and two arduino programs) to monitor smoke, switch between modes, and react to smoke with an alarm and sound bytes. There was a fair amount of Java programming and problem solving that went into materializing this device. I'm glad that I was able to do some Java again!</ebinw>
</h4>
<h4>
3/11: The Year is Over! -ish! Pretty sad. More updates to come over the next weeks, and maybe an emotional speech about how much programming class has meant to me.</ebinw>
