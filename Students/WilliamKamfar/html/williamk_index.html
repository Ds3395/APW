            <h2>Last Year's Project</h2>
            <p>For my project, I want to make a multiplayer 2D or 2.5D (3D models in a 2D space) fighting game like Guilty Gear -Strive- or BlazBlue Centralfiction with Visual Novel elements for storytelling in C# using Unity. This has been a passion project of mine for a while, and I want my game to create cool moments, and generate a sizable dedicated community like with Street Fighter Third Strike and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0">Evo Moment 37</a>. I want to add a cast of unique characters that are all fun to play, and embody the different fighting styles throughout the genre's history. Along with this cast, I want to add unique system/universal mechanics for this game as well as adding a Roman Cancel system (from Guilty Gear) as I really enjoy using it. I also want to add a soundtrack reminiscent of my favorite entries to the genre, as well as maps that take place at beautiful, stylistic vistas. If I have time, along with the fighting game itself, I want to add a story mode that really works to add more depth to the characters.</p>

            <h2>DeathBlow</h2>
            <p>A 2D fighting game that is based on a more volatile and deliberate kind of combat. Taking heavy influence from games like Sekiro and Guilty Gear Strive, DeathBlow will focus on blocking and parrying blows until the opportunity arrives to strike. Landing a solid blow will deal a significant amount of damage, and may grant you a deathblow at a low enough health percentage. By parrying or chipping away at their block, you can get your opponent in a stun and land a final blow. The game focuses on being aggressive but punishes overaggression. This game will implement rollback networking code that allows the game to feel responsive and fun. This game is more of a side project to Arachnid, but it holds a very special place in my heart.</p>

            <h2>Arachnid</h2>
            <p>Arachnid is a crossplay VR and PC multiplayer survival horror game that focuses on creating a sense of dread for the player. This project has been divided among three people in a way that allows them to each have a separate project that combines into one larger product at the end. In this game, you will be a group of exterminators sent to eliminate the Arachnid, a mysterious creature that lurks in the dark... While the lore and exact gameplay have not been fully planned out yet, the core idea is that the player will be navigating environments with several other players in order to hunt this creature. There will be several other creatures that the character has to deal with, and they have to manage their limited resources in order to survive. Check out the game at: <a href="https://swankypantsu.itch.io/arachnid-vr-horror-game?secret=EeUxw3YtwvfHWZHd6REq4XJto">Arachnid.Itch.io</a>. It will most likely be on Steam at some point, and you can check out the devlog channel at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwankyStudios">Swanky Studios</a>.</p>

            <h2>September</h2>
            <p>This month was mostly just forming groups, planning projects, and getting started on a basic build. I tried to start websites for the games and create itch.io pages, but I am not an HTML developer, so it proved to be difficult. I will improve this website later with some color and images, but I am not a designer. In terms of projects, I got a base working for Deathblow, and now all I need to do it work on animating everything as well as creating the collision detection system for the different moves in the game. The other notable achievement this month was that I managed to make a working build for VR and PC crossplay multiplayer that will serve as the base of the survival horror game. Chris, Owen, and I had a brief planning session, and we decided how to break the project into a bunch of separate projects that will come together. We also planned the visual and mechanical aspect of the game. I am expecting to have worked out all of the bugs with the multiplayer and finalize game mechanics by the end of next month. I did not get started on combat yet.</p>

            <h2>October</h2>
            <p>I filed an LLC with the State of New York, so I can start applying for game marketplaces. There were also a bunch of scope and plan changes over the course of the last month. We decided to work on the VR aspect of the game as a secondary project in order to create a more complete game. I began on working on gameplay feel and different systems of interaction. I want the game to feel more realistic, so I have been doing a lot of math to create the perfect acceleration curves for the character. I also started working on a backpack system that allows you to engage with different items. Finally, I started working with a different rendering engine in order to get the highest quality game. We are aiming for AAA quality, so I need to really refine and optmize everything. I basically just worked on constructing a framework which my partners can work in.<p>

            <h2>November 2nd</h2>
            <p>I finally managed to form an LLC! I will be registering my information with Steam and various other platforms in order to publish the project once it is finished. I am aiming to have a releasable demo by the end of the year. I also was working on rebuilding the movement system from the ground up which is taking significantly more time than I expected, but I should be able to finish everything this weekend. The main things I need to do now are work on the inventory system (which I have mapped out), and make the interactables (items, doors, cabinets, and buttons), so we can start constructing environments. With that done, I can combine my work with that of my partners and we can probably finish our demo.<p>

            <h2>November 17th</h2>
            <p>I worked on my project, and I managed to get a working inventory and interactions system. I still have not received an EIN, but as soon as I do, I will work on making a steam page for my game. While we still need to complete some content for the steam page, once done we can start marketing to the fullest. We have many of the necessary blocks in place to aim for a demo by the end of the year, and then our marketing will be in full force. We have been planning out our future approach, and we will see how things turn out. <p>

            <h2>December 8th, 2023</h2>
            <p>I have finally received all the information I need, and I am now working on registering my information with Steam, but since I am a minor, doing all this is significantly harder because I have to work with my uncle (who signs on my behalf). I should have the publisher page up soon and everything should be smooth sailing from there. I also registered a domain, made a corporate email for everyone, and set up a company website. Aside from just the representation side of things, I’ve also managed to get some work done on the game. I managed to code most of the inventory system to allow for the player to move around items and such as well as access several inventory tabs. While it is taking a while to finish everything, I’ve planned it out so that the game will have a demo by January 31st. I’ve also tried to get everyone at SwankyStudios on a schedule so I could monitor what they are doing and also make more consistent progress on the project. As always, game progress is slow, but It is happening. I also am trying to work with Sam Rabinor to help him publish his own game. I also have added the ability to move items around in the menus + interact with them.<p>

            <h2>December 22nd, 2023</h2>
            <p>While I tried to get work done on the menu systems, the last 2 weeks have been quite rough for progress. Since most of my classes have assigned some kind of major assignment/assessment that I either had to study for or write up. I want to get so much done, but Junior year is rough. Also, my family leaves for Christmas, so we celebrate it early with my grandfather… Aside from Junior year, I have been able to file for Steamworks and get accepted for publishing games and I started working on some basic systems for my game. I am still working on the menu systems because I have been so swamped with work recently that I have not made any considerable progress. Hopefully, I am able to make a lot of progress over the break in order to reach the ever approaching January deadline. I will definitely get more work done over the break, and I will fill out the information required to publish a game.</p>
