    <h1 id="main_header">My project page</h1>
    <p>For my contribution to the class website I added a page that displays the song I have last listened to on SoundCloud. Though this seems simple, it was somewhat 
    complex. The public SoundCloud API no longer accepts new users, but I was able to find an undocumented API, which had an endpoint that would provide me with what I was trying to get. However, I would only be able to get data from the endpoint if I made the request from soundcloud.com itself. Since my code runs on github.io, I wouldn't be able to directly access the SoundCloud API. I was able to work around this by using CORS Anywhere, a proxy that is able to circumvent the restriction. I then obtained the url of my most recent track from the json response, and I inserted the url into an embed element, so the track displays as a SoundCloud embed. I learned about the same-origin policy, cross origin resource sharing (CORS), and related web security topics.</p>
    <h2> My Project</h2>
    <p>I was thinking about utlizing machine learning for something related to music. I might try creating a tool to separate a track into individual stems (stems are essentially different insruments, like vocal and accompaniment), like <a href="https://github.com/deezer/spleeter">spleeter</a>.</p>
