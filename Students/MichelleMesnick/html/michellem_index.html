  <h1> Michelle's Game Hub
  <h4>
  <p>For my project, I was thinking about making a game hub. I already started coding a connect 4 game. This game is designed for two players but I would be interested in incorporating a bot to play with - this might require an AI component.
  <p>10/5/23: I set up the board so that the code understands when an object cannot pass through a column. I also created a circle class that allows the objects to understand whos turn it is. 
    <p>11/3/23: I made it so that when a column is clicked, the board knows whos turn it is and if the object can pass. If the object can pass, it will create a circle in the players color on the selected square.  
   </p>
   <p> 11/15/23: I worked on debugging my code. I met with Mr. Golanka who helped me adjust my program to incorporate for loops. This fixed my problem of having my code run over the objects so now my circles stay on the board.
