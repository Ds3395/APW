  10/14/2021: I have vague, disconnected ideas about what my project should be. I think that I want to do something with 3D modeling / printing, but we'll see.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  10/22/2021: I Was surprised to learn that Maya cost $1000, that is too much money. I have downloaded Blender instead. I took a course years ago on using Maya, but I remember nothing. I assume that they are similar but we'll see. There are a few tutorials that I'm going to check out.
</p>

<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  10/29/2021: I wasn't able to get anything done on my project this week because I was working on college applications, I'll get stuff done next week.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  11/4/2021: This week I watched and read a few tutorials on how to use Blender. I managed to load different objects into it, rather than just the starting object. Still figuring out how I could edit objects.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  11/11/2021: I've been researching for my teachback on the history of CGI in movies. It all started much earlier than I thought, but in the beginning it wasn't very good.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  11/18/2021: This week I made a ring of mountains. I accomplished this by loading a taurous and stretching out vertices on it until they formed into peaks around its edge.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  12/3/2021: This week I watched another tutorial on how to use blender. I learned about what each tool does to sculpt the object.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  12/10/2021: This week I figured out all the controls in blender, they are very interesting, it really enlightened my view of real life objects and perspective. I am not skilled with blender, I have no idea how a person could be so skilled as to make something like a human face, but I'm figuring it out.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  12/17/2021: Blender made my PC hot enough to boil water, then crashed. I may need to give it a rest. I am taking my PC to Best Buy to get it checked out over break.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  1/20/2022: My object has been printed. I have figured out the issue with my PC, my GPU fan does not spin, but I don't see a way to fix it. I have two possible paths from here: I could try to make another, more complicated object; or I could help someone else with their project.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  1/28/2022: I will make a new object. I need to take some tutorials first, but I intend to make a chair that a person is feasable capable of sitting in. 
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/3/2022: It took a little bit, but I made a rough approxomation of what a chair is. It's a bunch of rectangles so the edges are a bit jagged, but if you squint hard enough it looks like a chair.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/10/2022: I didn't watch any tutorials but I made a chair
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/18/2022: the chair is smooth now, not so sure about sittable as the base seems a bit narrow.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/25/2022: efforts are underway to un-merge every vertex individually, bit of a bummer but it was my mistake so I need to fix it. afterwards I'll try to make it so that the chair could stand.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  3/4/2022: I am going to see what I can do to add light and color, I'll also work with the camera tools.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  3/11/2022: I have a chair and a light, but what is a chair with no one to sit in it? I am making a person to sit in the chair.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  3/18/22: it's spring break, I have not done anything.
