  So far, I've begun to figure out the GECK.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  1/7/2020: as of today I have  completed my project by creating an invincible easy pete.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  I have done this by setting his health to 9999999. This means that while not nessecarily immortal, he is impossible to kill.
</p>

<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  1/22/2020: I intend to think bigger on the next project, Perhaps by adding a unique item to the game.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/4/2020: This week I re-read the guide on modding in order to get a good refresher on how to complete the project. As of yet I am unsure of what that would entail, but I believe that I will be adding my own files to the game.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  2/16/2020: THis cycle, i messed around with the INI file of the game, and altered the actorvalues of sevral other NPCs, for example: I made Sunny smiles always get a critical hit, I made Joe Cobb's unarmed punches kill people instantly, and I made Doc Mitchell invincible as well.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  3/7/2020: In the week of 3/7 I made little progress on the project.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  4/9/2020: In the cycle of 4/9 I managed to take one of the characters normally relegated to the game's DLC and pull him into the base game. It is a little bit buggy, he doesn't interect perfectly with the world around him, but I learned that I could do it.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  4/23/2020: In the cycle of 4/23 I destroyed the game by making esay pete 200x his normal size. This prevented it from running. What I ended up needing to do was uninstall and reinstall the game to delete all the messed up program files on my computer.
</p>

<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  5/13/2020: In the week of 5/13 I mastered the art of making more easy petes, but I am still not sure how to rename an easy pete. More to follow.
</p>
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  5/20/2020: I have done it, In my copy of Fallout: New Vegas there is a new character known as "Hard Pete". He is currently identical to regular Easy Pete in every way, this is subject to change.
</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  5/24/2020: I have successfully completed my project. There is now a rather large invincible entity known as "Hard Pete." He is about 9 feet tall and weilds a grenade launcher. This is what I set out to do when I set out for this project.
</p>

<p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'red')" onmouseup="myFucntion(this,'black')">
  9/23/2021: I'm gonna make a new website I guess
