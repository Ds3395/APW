			<p>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
			payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
			financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
			benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
			We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
			The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
			hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
			the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
			events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
			long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
			attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
			network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
			basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
			proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.</p>

			<h1 > Goodbye World</h1>
			<p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
			trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
			most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
			Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
			avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
			minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
			and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
			be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
			A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
			can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
			over a communications channel without a trusted party.</p>
