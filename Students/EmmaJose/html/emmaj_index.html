  <p>So far, I have been working on making a Twilio account and getting the details of that set up. Before I work on automating a text message scheduled by someone else, I feel like the best place to start is by establishing how to do it for myself. However, the one issue I have faced thus far is that I can not plug in alternate phone numbers. For some reason, it currently does not want to work, so now my next step is trouble shooting that. 
  </p>
  <p>Entry (November 3,2023): I have been studying the Twilio in and outs through their website to gain further knowledge on the topic. In addition to this, I have mastered how to send messages to my phone and others' phones, but I am facing two challenges: how to not have it say "Sent from your Twilio trial account" before every message and have the code work through the non Twilio website (when I put it into my actual pycharm and not on the Twilio website, it claims that Twilio does not exist though I had previously installed it to my library).
  </p>
   <p>Entry (November 17,2023): I have now made it so that I can send a text from one number to the next; however, I might go back an tweak it later. The process for inputting the information and sending it with Twilio is a little clunky, and may be something I revisit later on.
  </p>
   <p>Entry (December 8,2023): I have moved on to working on the X (Twitter) portion of my project. IN doing so, I am using a system called Tweepy (which is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API) to aid in the process. While I have set up some base code (which is featured below), my next step would be to create a Twitter account in order to create a Tweepy API access token and key. I tried to find a way around this, yet I was unsuccessful so far.
