							<h2>The Submission</h2>
							<p>The prompt for this year (their 6th year) was to design something that rethinkings our products, environments, services, and systems and optimizes it for the pandemic and probably post-pandemic world. I first read through their resources. I then took to inspiration from what they want and what it means to "design" something from their past winners. As I was flipping through, I noticed that a design for an app that fixes discrimination when applying for a job got an honourable mention or some other form of an award. This made me think back to Dr. Foodie. It is initially an AI powered "food journal" with other features to help the modern consumer weave their way through nutrition. At first I thought, damn this isn't COVID-19 related. And then I realized that it actually is! And so, I took some of the screenshots that developers are required to make for the App Store and put them into an image with the name of the app down below.<br><br>Here's the thing: I don't have any image editing software and I wouldn't know how to use it. Meanwhile, I wanted to add shadows, and all of this fancy stuff to the image. So, I decided to code it. Xcode lets developers either test or play around with code quickly in what's called a Swift Playground. So I made a file for that, and without any struggle was able to easily get the image to look like this. For some reason, I couldn't change the text color. And I was dancing around with making the text white on white with a shadow. But now I'm really into it. All I did then was take a screenshot and used preview to make it 8.5"x11".</p>

							<h2>Journal</h2>
							<p>Below is what I submitted for their questionnaires. Each had to be answered in 50 words or less which kind of sucked.</p>
              <p><strong>Tell us about the health-related obstacle you identified.</strong><br><i>What specifically about it makes it a challenge and for whom? Is this something you observed or experienced? Might this also be a challenge for other users? (50 words or less)</i></p>
							<p>This pandemic has negatively affected the food system. Especially for two parties: the consumers and the restaurants. Research shows that during the pandemic, consumer's diets started to worsen. On top of that, local restaurants have been getting creamed from lack of business. I experienced both of these phenomena first hand.</p>
              <p><strong>Tell us about your design idea.</strong><br><i>Describe your design, its key concepts, and how it works. (50 words or less)</i></p>
							<p>The user snaps a picture of what their eating to add to their daily journal, an AI reads it and displays the nutrition facts. Without being instructed, the user is improving themself of their own volition. Meanwhile, the AI recommends the user healthy, local businesses; helping to stimulate the economy.</p>
              <p><strong>Tell us about the impact of your design for your user(s).</strong><br><i>Describe how and why your design creates a healthier world for the user(s) you identified as well as a broader audience. How will users access your design? (50 words or less)</i></p>
							<p>Indisputably, our minds work better with concise and relevant data. Pure numbers can make improving our eating habits become almost instinct. On top of that, this product is a simple and accessible mobile application. Anyone within civilization can use the personalized AI which is great at matching customers with restaurants.</p>
							<p><strong>Update</strong><br>The results are in and this project didn't place. Which was expected of course. But, it didn't hurt to give it a try.</p>
