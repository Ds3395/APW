							<h2>The Menu Bar</h2>
							<p>The previous website had a dropdown menu of the links for the student's pages, I decided to take that a step further and make it a bit more functional. The code for the dropdown functionality, actually is the same as what my predecessors made, I merely just added a  gradient background, and a column-row based organization for each student's section. Now I felt that, with the amount of students, the html might look really crowded and ugly, which I hate. So, I wanted to adopt more of a scaffold-automated style programming with more Javascript functionality. I made Projects, Sections, etc. objects, and a main array that is organized so that on the window.onload function, the proper html could be populated. The code for the menu bar was the majority of the main.js file and there is documentation within the file to ad your own project.</p>

							<h2>The Front-End</h2>
							<p>I felt that, since this website almost smybolizes our work as class, its design should not be taken lightly. Hence, I first went to Dribbble.com (a website where professional UI/UX designers post their "shots" and work and I can view for free). I took inspiration from a really modern one. The page's background image (which I love) was actually placed into the website be an alum (I don't know when) and I decided to use it the way that I noticed in the Dribbble shot that I found. I also wanted to make some animations for the page when the user opens it. This includes fading in the title and transforming the menu bar with a scale that is originated at its right. Hopefully other students could make even better animations.</p>

							<h2>The Details</h2>
							<p>One thing that I appreciated about the previous website was that its color scheme and overall design matched the <a href="https://trevor.org" target="_blank">trevor.org</a> website. I made sure to translate that into this new version. I made sure that, when I was using assets from the <a href="https://trevor.org" target="_blank">trevor.org</a>, I linked to them directly and not download them to make things much more cleaner. Another thing that I tried to adopt were these little red seperators with a blocky design that I saw on the <a href="https://trevor.org" target="_blank">trevor.org</a> website. The specific "red" color that was provided (I believe that I saw that Mr. Lindow was the one who put that color) was "firebrick".</p>

							<h2>Journal</h2>
							<p>Overall, I would say that I tried to do my part in a way that others could build off of easily. Independently, I only touched the top part, and all the stuff in below, such as the description and the example projects where the ideas of my peers. I remember one class where we ended up making it so that I was sharing my screen, and everyone would say how to design the other elements. "Oh, add a red border to the description and center it," they might have said something along those lines, and I would go to the style.css file, and add border-width: 3px; border-color: firebrick; or some code like that in the proper element. It was pretty fun to work in a group.<br><br>Actually, before I started anything, I made sure to duplicate the proper files and move them to their own directory in the archives folder so that one could view the old site. It is also linked in the menu bar.<br><br>That reminds me, a big part of this assignment was to also do our part in reorganizing the entire shared GitHub folder so that all the Alumn's projects are under an Archives topic. I tried to organize the Archives folder under 2018, 2019, etc. I would be able to determine this based on the commit dates in the Github. I also sorted out the teacher's websites into their own directory. Though this change might want to be reintegrated into the other directories based on the future structure.</p>
