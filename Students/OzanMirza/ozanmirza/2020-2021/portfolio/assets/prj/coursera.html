							<h1>Online College Courses</h1>
							<p class="major">Almost like <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a>, Coursera is an online tool where education institutions can upload their own courses for anyone to learn. My mom bought a one-year subscription in the hopes that I would use this oppurtunity to take courses uploaded by colleges that I could be interested in in the future.</p>

							<h2>Yale University</h2>
							<p>I am currently enrolled in two 10 week courses offered by professors at Yale.<br><br>The first one is "The Science of Well-Being" taught by Dr. Laurie Santos. She is a cognitive scientist and Professor of Psychology at Yale University amoung her other leadership positions at the university. This course is teaching us how we can be more aware to make better desicions that lets us lead happier (a mentally healthier) lives.<br><br>The other course that I am enrolled in from Yale is "Introduction to Negotiation: A Strategic Playbook for Becoming a Principled and Persuasive Negotiator" taught by Mr. Barry Nalebuff. Mr. Nalebuff is a Milton Steinbach Professor of Management at Yale School of Management and author who specializes in business strategy and game theory. In this course, we are using principles, algorithims, and strategy to negotiate more efficiently and in a way that expands the pie for all parties involved.</p>

							<h2>Princeton University</h2>
							<p>I am currently enrolled in two 10 week courses offered by professors at Princeton.<br><br>The first one that I am taking is called "Algorithms, Part 1" taught by Mr. Kevin Wayne and Mr. Robert Sedgewick. Both of whom are Computer Science Professors and Lecturers for over 2 decades. Mr. Sedgewick is actually a founding chair of the department. This course covers the first part of the book that they wrote called "Algorithms". Once I complete it, I will take "Algorithms, Part 2". I like their teaching style. Personally, I always find myself lost when learning about algorithms online, but this time I find myself grasping the content better.<br><br>The other course that I am learning, offered by the same two professors is called "Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose". This is also the first part of another two part course. I will also be taking the second one once I am finished with the first one. This course is actually just about basic programming concepts. But hey! It's never a bad idea to refresh one's fundamentals.</p>

							<h2>Stanford University</h2>
							<p>I am currently enrolled in two 10 week courses offered by professors at Stanford.<br><br>The first one that I am taking is called "Game Theory" (and is actually a collaboration between Stanford University and The University of British Columbia) taught by a professor of Economics, Dr. Matthew O. Jackson, and two professors of Computer Science, Dr. Kevin Leyton-Brown and Dr. Yoav Shoham. I have always known of game theory and that it can be very useful to train my mindset with it when I am an adult. I have found myself exposed to some of its basic concepts before, but either haven't been able to comprehend them, or just completely forgot about them. Hopefully, this course will be the starting point of a long jouney. Oh wait! I just remembered! I made an entire programming project that teaches game theory (I think) and submitted it to the WWDC Scholarship program. I didn't get it, but another developer commented on how cool it was so maybe I'll get it this year who knows? Probably not though because of how big its gotten over the years.<br><br>The other course that I am taking from this university is called "Social and Economic Networks: Models and Analysis" taught by Dr. Matthew O. Jackson, a professor of Economics. I read a book over the summer called "The Square and the Tower" by Niall Ferguson. It was about how social power and hierarchies shaped the world and humanity. And the key difference between the network of the town square (less rules, more scalable) and the church tower (have to climb through leadership positions). I was fascinated by what the book had to say, so I knew that this course would be very important to try out. I feel like both courses go hand in hand and I am really interested in them both.</p>

							<h2>Journal</h2>
							<p>I really enjoy these courses so far. They range around a couple hours each week. I will definetly (if I am allowed to) save my code from the Princeton courses onto my GitHub. I feel like even though I am not taking as much programming courses as one might expect, it is just as important to grow one's knowledge in a balanced manner. And I will definetly be using what I learn in the other courses and apply them to my coding projects.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I have now been doing these courses for a couple of weeks or maybe more. I am almost done with the Intrdoction to the Art of Negotiation one. I just need to complete those Master Quizes and a bunch of other assignments for the other classes. I talked to Mr. Golanka about it, and he agreed that, with the level of challenge and the amount of content that I am learning, it would be appropriate to apply for an Independent Study with this for this semester. The link to the Google Doc can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7lTcLgw1iFKG4LT9VGvHv6hDSS6oY-TaYLrHC8LxdA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
