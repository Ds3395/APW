							<h2>Helpful Chess Timer</h2>
							<p>I updated the UI and overall functionality of this app. Adding gradients, a settings page, a pause/play button, etc. Originally it actually didn't work. I also added some ads on it.</p>

							<p>I decided to keep the overall design of it. I felt that the cartoony aspect of it was very original. I did make sure to improve the User Defaults system by using a JSONEncoder.</p>

							<p>I actually did quite a bit on here. I tried to update this a long time go, but then gave up. I tried to make a bluetooth option. I even worked on it for this version, but ended up giving up again. What I did add was a saving the game mode. and some more levels. I improved the overall design from around maybe 3 buttons to much more stuff.</p>

							<h2>Quick Weather</h2>
							<p>This is a Mac app that resides in the user's very top bar. I tried to mix the HTML/CSS/JS code with the Swift code. The actual weather information and graphics is from the former, meanwhile the location handling is from the latter. I originally hosted it on a URL that stopped working, which I quickly fixed. I also fixed the non-responsive Google Places API.</p>

								<h2>Sleek Weather</h2>
								<p>This app I made an entire year before I tried updating it again. Isn't that funny? I tried improving the app icon to look a little more 3d ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Hmm... I can't seem to remember other stuff that I worked on. I think mostly maintainance and a bit of the UI?</p>

								<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
								<p>This is another of my Mac apps and it, this time, only uses the native code. That is, except for the multiplayer feature. I think that I also just worked on maintainance for this app again. Nothing special.</p>

								<h2>Hourly Habits</h2>
								<p>I originally made this as per request by my mother. For some reason it stopped working. I also messed up the notification system. I improved the overall structure of the app, the way that the user adds a new "session", the way that they can view their session, and the way that they get their notifications. I also wanted to work with a "glowy" UI with a mix gradients, shadows, and bezier paths.</p>

							<h2>Journal</h2>
							<p>In summary, really there is nothing very significant about this. It's just regular maintainance. I did fail to mention how much ads I put on my apps (a lot). Dr. Henry reccomended me to create a $0.99 ad free version of them or to create an IAP (in-app purchases) option. I'll definetly look into it next semester when I get the time.</p>
