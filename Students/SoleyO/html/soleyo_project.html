		<h1>Ciao! and welcome to what will hopefully be a successful project page!
</h1>
<div class="text"><strong>Oct 1:</strong>💚💚By the end of the year I want to have built my own website, to showcase my photography, from scratch. To do this, I will need to familiarise myself with HTML, CSS and renew my Java... skills? Confidence is most definitely key!!! Anyways, to do this I will use the Odin Project HTML CSS JS online course as a resource. Ideally, I would be able to complete this course and then make my website, but since I am not sure how long the ~course~ will take, I think it does not make sense to say finish course by X Yth, 2021/2022. Rather, I will work on the website in bits in pieces, while taking the course. If all works as planned, I will have a website that I can buy a domain for and use for, dare I say, the rest of my life?💚💚</p>

<div class="text">Oct 15: 💚💚This week I started the Odin Project and began selecting my photographs for my website (obviously not very code-related, but considering I am working on building a website for my photography, I thought it would be worth mentioning). At first, I was tempted to skip through their introductory pages, however, I ended up going through them thoroughly and reading all attached/linked material. It was both interesting and comforting that they began the course with lessons on how to ask questions and approach coding. They had suggestions for how to work (25 mins working, 5 min break) and what to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and confused. I got some good vibes from it! Haha. During their “knowledge checks,” I recorded and answered questions in a google document, to interact more with the lesson and not only read. I also joined their Discord community/ linked it to my GitHub, which seemed very cool and exciting -- wow, this is free!??! Lastly, the final step of this 6 part intro was “How Does the Web Work?”. It was pretty time-consuming, including watching videos, reading articles, and answering questions. Below is a screenshot of my progress from the Odin site.💚💚

<div class="text">Oct 22: 💚💚This week I finished the installations and Git Basics parts of the foundations subsection of the course. Since I already have Git installed, terminal, and Sublime Text, I did not have to do much for the installations part. The Git Basics definetly made me feel more comfortable with the rudimentary elements of Git Hub and using commands in Terminal. I also read some articles on my Teach Back topic, even though it's a whiles away. This weekend I hope to complete the HTML Foundations, and then I will add an update since this week was hectic and my update is lacking. Hopefully I can spruse up my project page too!💚💚

<div class="text"><strong>Oct 29:</strong>💚💚This week I was primarily focused on wrapping up my college application... which you both so graciously allowed me to work on during class😅🙏 many thanks! I am continuing the Odin project, this time the lesson was: Intro to HTML and CSS. The HTML part was a bit of a recap on the work I did in order to code my personal page that links this project page! Helpful for reinforcing syntax I need to commit to memory... now I know why I need the doctype at the top of my "code"
	<h1>Check</h1>
    <h2>This</h2>
    <h3>Out.</h3>
    <h4>Pretty</h4>
    <h5>Cool</h5>
    <h6>Huh?</h6>
    <strong>I think so!</strong>
   Changed the color of my page... got bored of the green. Manifesting my ED choice w/ the blue haha. I also bolded all the dates in hopes it would make it easier to decode my messay weekly updtaes, but to me it didnt make much of a difference:(. That's all for now, unfortunately. More work coming up! Have a great weekend :D

<div class="text"><strong>Nov 6:</strong>💚💚Ok! Odin Project continued.... so this week I was still working through the HTML Foundations. Examples of what I learned about was ordered and unordered lists, easily differeniated by ul and ol. I enjoy the simplicity, why overcomplicate! Moving on ... LINKS AND IMAGES. This was pretty cool and definitely will be applicable when I start my website. Heres a little sample click thingy to a drawing/painting of mine: 
   <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t8MgE_drYEzYX0M7hk3YwgwrHgtet-vh/view?usp=sharing">click me</a>
The rest of that sub lesson was pretty interesting, mainly about relative and absolute links. I hope to get more done next week. At this point I am excited to move onto the CSS lesson and start making my photography website. Also, been doing some nytimes reading on facebooks move to META. my teachback topic is evolving by the days!😁 Okay that is all, yay, have a great weekend.

<div class="text"><strong>Nov 12:</strong>💚💚Ciao ciao!! Still working my way through the Odin Project, these reflections have become pretty repetetive so I will try to keep it short and sweet :) I learned about alt and href attributes and how to name html files (to organize your website and enhance to UI). After that is putting all my knowledge to use my making a website. The next part of the Odin Project is CSS. This weekend I am going to make a file to a new webpage where I will start my photography website. For now I will just do a basic outline in HTML but overtime make it nicer with CSS. By Winter Break I want to have layed out exactly how I want to the website to be structured in terms of multiples pages, image carnivals/slidesows, descriptions, etc. Have a lovely weekend!!! 💚💚</p> 
</div>
<div class="text"><strong>Nov 19:</strong>💚💚First off I am so sorry I am putting in the update on Saturday! More Odin project and figuring out the structure of my website. As I mentioned in my last update, the part of the Odin Project I'm working through right now is the CSS Foundations. CSS is a bit more complicated I feel, than the previous HTML lesson, so it took me more time to go through. In conclusion I went through the foundation CSS page, took notes and really tried to understand all the material:) Bonne weekend !!💚💚</p> 
</div>
<div class="text"><strong>Dec 3:</strong>💚💚This week I prepared for my Teachback!! That is all :D Hopefully it goes well, I am excited to see the conversations it sparks💚💚</p> 
</div>
<div class="text"><strong>Dec 11:</strong>💚💚This week was incredibly busy and I was unable to work on my project much at all. Today (Saturday) I went to the Odin Project and took a look through the CSS lesson. CSS looks really cool and this will be exciting to try and use for my website, which I anticipate to do next week. Have a great weekend and I apologize for the lack of work!💚💚</p>
