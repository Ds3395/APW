<p> Reflection

For the class project, I created a really fun and cute webpage. There were two buttons: one for music and one to show an animated
gif of a cute animal. The user can click on either of those buttons or, for maximum fun, click on both of the buttons. The webpage is designed to relax the user with soothing music and cuteness. I learned how to add music to a webpage and add in an image/animated video. In addition, I also learned how to add text with bold or italics, etc. and I've learned how to actually create a webpage. 

For the next project, I am working with Will on something animated. It's probably going to be a video game of some sorts. My goal is to work effectively but also to actually create a stable, functional, fun, high quality game by the end of this year - not have everything look like it was last minute.
